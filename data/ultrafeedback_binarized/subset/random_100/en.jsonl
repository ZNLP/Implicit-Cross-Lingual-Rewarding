{"instruction": "Please answer this: Build a movie plot around this: Who is given the defense in the case? Lance Corporal Harold Dawson and Private Louden Downey\n++++++++\nAnswer: Late one evening, at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, two Marines, Private First Class Louden Downey (James Marshall) and Lance Corporal Harold Dawson (Wolfgang Bodison) are arrested for assaulting and killing a fellow Marine of their unit, PFC William Santiago (Michael DeLorenzo).At first it is assumed that they attacked Santiago because he reported Dawson to the Naval Investigative Service (NIS) for illegally firing his gun at a guard on the Cuban side of the island. However, Naval investigator and lawyer Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway (Demi Moore) suspects that Dawson and Downey, who were otherwise exemplary marines, were carrying out a \"Code Red\", an unofficial act of discipline in which soldiers are submitted to methods akin to bullying in order to get them to improve their performance, toe the line or follow procedure. Santiago compared unfavorably to his fellow Marines, being clumsy and lagging behind on exercises and was socially ostracized. He denounced Dawson in an attempt to be transferred away from Guantanamo.Dawson and Downey are taken to a military prison in Washington D.C. to await trial. Galloway requests to defend them but the case is given to Lieutenant Junior Grade Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise), an inexperienced U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps lawyer. Kaffee has a reputation for arranging plea bargains and has never even argued a case in a court room, which gives him time to devote himself to his passion for softball. It is indicated that he has a psychological fear about having to match up to his late father, Lionel Kaffee, a leading attorney, who is regarded as one of the great trial lawyers of recent times. Galloway manages to get herself appointed as Downey's lawyer, thus playing a part in the proceedings. The third member of the defense team is Kaffee's friend Lt. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak).Kaffee meets with the defendants and finds that they are of the strictest type of Marines - those that serve in a \"forward area\" (on the line between their country and an...\n\n\nPlease answer this: Build a movie plot around this: Who is stabbed in the stomach? Penn\n++++++++\nAnswer: Penn & Teller (playing themselves) appear on a local New York television show called 'Weekend Live' where they perform one of their famous upside-down gags. Penn & Teller are the so-called \"bad boys of magic\" where they perform shock and gore illusion tricks for recongition. Teller never talks, while Penn never stops talking.When the gag is over, Penn jokingly comments to the TV host that he wishes someone were trying to kill him. Teller again shows off another shock gag when he \"slices\" Penn's throat on the air with a trick knife complete with splirting blood. Carlotta, Penn & Teller's booking agent and manager, watches the show with her ususal frustration at the guys attempts to show off.Soon after, the two magicians are off to a scheduled show in Atlantic City. At the airport, a religious zealot confronts the aethiest Penn about his comments from the television show the night before and produces a fake gun.Teller and Carlotta play a prank on Penn while going through security when Teller keeps planting a steel ball in one of Penn's coat pockes which makes him cause a scene with the security guards. Afterwords, Penn gets back at Teller by planting a toy gun on him while at the airport and having him detained by security.Penn, Teller, and Carlotta arrive in Philadelphia and take a van to Atlantic City where they check into the Trump Hotel and begin their first show that very night, with the final illusion being Teller strapped to a table and being \"drilled to death\" by overhead power drills.While having dinner with Carlotta at the hotel's restaurant, she tells Penn about her wealthy Uncle Ernesto who is dying from a tumor.

Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), was a homemaker who had worked as a mutual fund marketing executive. Swift was named after the American singer-songwriter James Taylor. She has a younger brother named Austin, who is an actor. Swift spent the early years of her life on a Christmas tree farm which her father purchased from one of his clients. She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori School, run by Franciscan nuns, before transferring to The Wyndcroft School. The family then moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, where she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.At the age of nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her \"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure that she needed to go to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a music career. At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to visit Nashville record labels and submitted a demo tape of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers. However, she was rejected since \"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different\".When Swift was about 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her how to play guitar and helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading to her writing \"Lucky You\". In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York-based music manager Dan Dymtrow.

Sweden turns out to be far more liberal sexually than the United States. Bob, having met an attractive interior designer, Karin, decides to take her away for a romantic weekend at a mountain resort. JoJo, however, has accepted a similar offer from Erik, who is Bob's new assistant. Originally seen as a respectable suitor, Erik turns out to be a playboy and a cad. A girl thought to be his cousin, Marti, is actually a former girlfriend. Kenny turns up and brings Marti along to the resort, where the three couples continue to awkwardly encounter one another. Kenny finally has his fill of Erik, knocking him out with his guitar. On a voyage home, the ship's captain performs a double wedding ceremony, that turns out to be invalid, due to a navigation error.

On their way to Battle Creek they meet Charles Ossining, hoping to make a fortune by exploiting the fad for health food cereals. Ossining finds a partner in Goodloe Bender. Having enlisted the services of George Kellogg, the doctor's estranged adopted son, they attempt to produce \"Kellogg's Perfo Flakes.\"  In the sanitarium, Will Lightbody is separated from his wife, and is soon harboring lustful thoughts toward Nurse Graves and patient Ida Muntz.

{"instruction": "At present, copyright is ‘automatic’. From the moment an original work is created, the author enjoys all the benefits that copyright protection entails, without the need to complete a registration, deposit the work, mark it with a copyright notice, or comply with any other statutorily prescribed formality. However, the digital revolution has caused a paradigm shift in the way copyright-protected works are created and consumed. Copyright law is now facing significant challenges arising from the need to establish legal certainty over copyright claims, improve rights clearance, and enhance the free flow of information. Inevitably, proposals to introduce formalities in copyright law (or reintroduce them, as the absence of formalities has not always been the norm) have risen to prominence in legal debate.\nThis book examines whether reintroducing copyright formalities is legally feasible. Based on a comprehensive and thorough analysis of copyright formalities, it sets out to establish the extent to which the current copyright system allows for their reintroduction. To this end, the author describes the role and functions of formalities, revisits the history of formalities at the national and international levels, examines the scope of the international prohibition on formalities, and scrutinizes the rationales behind this prohibition, including an in-depth examination of the validity of the argument that copyright is a ‘natural right’ and therefore should be protected independently of formalities.\nThe author skilfully evaluates and contrasts the conflicting theories according to which formalities, on the one hand, add legal certainty to claims on the ownership of property, and, on the other, hamper individual authors from seeking adequate protection for their works. This book makes an important contribution to legal science by answering questions that so far have been neglected or only marginally addressed. To the degree that current copyright law permits reintroducing formalities, the author posits the specifications that will determine to a great extent what role and functions they may eventually fulfil: depending on the aims to be achieved, lawmakers must choose which types of formalities shall be imposed, and what their legal consequences shall be. This book goes a long way towards reinforcing the foundation for those decisions.\nChapter 2. The Role and Functions of Formalities in Intellectual Property Law.\nChapter 3. The History of Formalities in National Copyright Law.\nChapter 4. The Prohibition on Formalities in International Copyright Law.\nChapter 5. Contextualizing the International Prohibition on Copyright Formalities.\nChapter 6. Relativizing the Legal-Theoretical Concerns with Copyright Formalities.\nChapter 7. Summary and Conclusion. Can copyright formalities be reintroduced in a way that balances the need for legal certainty and protection for authors with the free flow of information in the digital age? Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of different arguments for and against reintroducing these formalities.", "instruction_id": "65b7476396093db797840e83dc01d167862bfb625b278077005db9d4eaeebece"}

{"instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nThe second divisional game of the year for the 3-0 Bears, looking for their first 4-0 start in seven seasons, took place at Ford Field against the 2-1 Detroit Lions. Since 2001, the Bears had won 17 of the meetings between the two, compared to Detroit's 9. The Bears defense, ranked 19th in scoring defense with 24.7 points per game and 25th in yards allowed with 383.0, had to keep up with the Lions' 4th-ranked offense, who recorded 410.7 yards per game 27.3 PPG, sixth in the league. The Lions also had running back Reggie Bush return from a knee injury; Bush had recorded 260 yards and a touchdown in the first two games. However, the Lions' leading receiver Nate Burleson broke his arm in a car accident, which meant additional focus on Calvin Johnson for the Bears. Expectations were for Charles Tillman to cover Johnson, who was limited by Tillman to 15 catches, no touchdowns and an average of 62.3 receiving yards in the last three games. Although Tillman had suffered groin and knee injuries that left him questionable for the game, he was later listed as active against the Lions. However, Johnson recorded 40 catches for 20+ yards in 2012, and the Bears allowed the Steelers to gain 20 yards or more in nine plays. To attempt to combat Johnson, the Bears switched from the pressure defense run in the first three games to the cover 2. In the battle on the line of scrimmage, the Bears had to contain Ndamukong Suh and Nick Fairley, while the Lions had to protect Matthew Stafford from Julius Peppers and Corey Wootton. Offensively, the Bears also had to survive the crowd, who helped the Bears commit nine false start penalties in 2011. Neither team scored a touchdown in the first quarter, instead both scoring field goals, which extended into the first score of the second quarter. Later in the quarter, Matt Fort&#233; scored on a 53-yard run, allowing the Bears to take the 10-6 lead. However, after a David Akers field goal, the Lions would score three unanswered touchdowns, all within 3 minutes, 26 seconds: Micheal Spurlock's 57-yard punt return led to Matthew Stafford's 1-yard run, while Jay Cutler was intercepted by Glover Quin, which set up Stafford's 2-yard pass to Calvin Johnson; finally, the Lions scored after Reggie Bush found a hole and hurdled over Bears' safety Major Wright en route to a 37-yard touchdown. The 27 points scored in the quarter was the most by the Lions since September 30, 2007 against the Bears. The Bears ended the half with a field goal, but continued to trail 30-13. After the Bears kicked a field goal in the third quarter, Cutler was intercepted again, this time by Louis Delmas. However, Chicago regained possession after Stafford's pass to Johnson was kicked and caught by Wright. Three plays later, Cutler was sacked by Ndamukong Suh, and fumbled; the ball was picked up by Nick Fairley, who ran four yards for the touchdown. In the fourth quarter, Akers kicked another field goal to put the Lions up 40-16. Afterwards, the Bears began to mount a charge, with Cutler throwing a 14-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery with less than four minutes in the game, followed by a two-point conversion on another pass to Jeffery. With 43 seconds remaining, a ten-yard pass to Earl Bennett and a two-point conversion off a throw to Brandon Marshall drew the Bears within eight points, but the eventual onside kick was recovered by Lions receiver Kris Durham, allowing the Lions to clinch the 40-32 victory. Statistically, the Bears offense struggled. Cutler completed 27 of 47 passes for 317 yards, two touchdowns, three interceptions and a 65.6 passer rating. Cutler's three interceptions and fumble tied his turnover amount in the first three games. The offense also had trouble on third down; despite being ranked ninth in third down efficiency, the Bears failed to convert until there were 47 seconds left in the game to end the game converting just 1 of 13 third downs.\n\nWho caught touchdowns from Jay Cutler?", "instruction_id": "c4577765cc7da1093ba6c29a137e3f4cbb87d4a7e7af667c30ff26b64b5f8489"}

{"instruction": "Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be shown a Persian passage. You need to write a Persian question for the passage. Your question should be answerable based on the passage and only have one correct answer.\nProblem:در گذشته از واژه سیم برای نامیدن این فلز استفاده می‌شد. نقره یا سیم یک عنصر شیمیایی با علامت Ag است. نقره فلزی نرم، سفیدرنگ، براق و جذاب است که در بین تمام عناصر، بالاترین میزان رسانایی الکتریکی و در بین تمام فلزات بیشترین میزان رسانایی گرمایی را دارد. نقره در طبیعت هم به صورت خالص و هم به صورت آلیاژ طبیعی همراه با طلا و دیگر فلزات و هم در برخی سنگ‌های معدنی یافت می‌شود. بیشترین تولید نقره جهان به عنوان جانبی از استخراج مس، نیکل، سرب و روی به دست می‌آید. نمک‌های محلول نقره به ویژه AgNO3، با غلظت بیش از ۲ گرم (۰٫۰۷۰ اوز) کشنده هستند. ترکیبات نقره به آهستگی توسط بافت‌های بدن جذب می‌شوند و پیگمان‌هایی آبی یا سیاه در پوست ایجاد می‌کنند. آینه‌های معمولی با پوشاندن شیشه با لایه‌ای از آلومینیوم یا جیوه تولید می‌شوند اما آینه‌هایی که قدرت انعکاس بالایی دارند معمولاً با لایه‌ای از نقره در پشت آن‌ها ساخته می‌شوند. تاثیر بر محیط‌زیست: AgNO3 خاصیت خورندگی دارد و ضروری است در هنگام مصرف از دستکش استفاده کرد و این ماده از مواد مخرب محیط‌زیست به حساب می‌آید و لازم است از ورود آن به محیط‌زیست جلوگیری شود. \nSolution:", "instruction_id": "32b2b126b933cbbc52029ee673d2df0298171542338b178fef7c44a78583ca92"}
