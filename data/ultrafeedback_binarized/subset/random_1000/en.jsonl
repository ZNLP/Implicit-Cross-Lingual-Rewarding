{"instruction": "Please answer this: Build a movie plot around this: Who is given the defense in the case? Lance Corporal Harold Dawson and Private Louden Downey\n++++++++\nAnswer: Late one evening, at the U.S. Naval Base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, two Marines, Private First Class Louden Downey (James Marshall) and Lance Corporal Harold Dawson (Wolfgang Bodison) are arrested for assaulting and killing a fellow Marine of their unit, PFC William Santiago (Michael DeLorenzo).At first it is assumed that they attacked Santiago because he reported Dawson to the Naval Investigative Service (NIS) for illegally firing his gun at a guard on the Cuban side of the island. However, Naval investigator and lawyer Lieutenant Commander Joanne Galloway (Demi Moore) suspects that Dawson and Downey, who were otherwise exemplary marines, were carrying out a \"Code Red\", an unofficial act of discipline in which soldiers are submitted to methods akin to bullying in order to get them to improve their performance, toe the line or follow procedure. Santiago compared unfavorably to his fellow Marines, being clumsy and lagging behind on exercises and was socially ostracized. He denounced Dawson in an attempt to be transferred away from Guantanamo.Dawson and Downey are taken to a military prison in Washington D.C. to await trial. Galloway requests to defend them but the case is given to Lieutenant Junior Grade Daniel Kaffee (Tom Cruise), an inexperienced U.S. Navy Judge Advocate General's Corps lawyer. Kaffee has a reputation for arranging plea bargains and has never even argued a case in a court room, which gives him time to devote himself to his passion for softball. It is indicated that he has a psychological fear about having to match up to his late father, Lionel Kaffee, a leading attorney, who is regarded as one of the great trial lawyers of recent times. Galloway manages to get herself appointed as Downey's lawyer, thus playing a part in the proceedings. The third member of the defense team is Kaffee's friend Lt. Sam Weinberg (Kevin Pollak).Kaffee meets with the defendants and finds that they are of the strictest type of Marines - those that serve in a \"forward area\" (on the line between their country and an...\n\n\nPlease answer this: Build a movie plot around this: Who is stabbed in the stomach? Penn\n++++++++\nAnswer: Penn & Teller (playing themselves) appear on a local New York television show called 'Weekend Live' where they perform one of their famous upside-down gags. Penn & Teller are the so-called \"bad boys of magic\" where they perform shock and gore illusion tricks for recongition. Teller never talks, while Penn never stops talking.When the gag is over, Penn jokingly comments to the TV host that he wishes someone were trying to kill him. Teller again shows off another shock gag when he \"slices\" Penn's throat on the air with a trick knife complete with splirting blood. Carlotta, Penn & Teller's booking agent and manager, watches the show with her ususal frustration at the guys attempts to show off.Soon after, the two magicians are off to a scheduled show in Atlantic City. At the airport, a religious zealot confronts the aethiest Penn about his comments from the television show the night before and produces a fake gun.Teller and Carlotta play a prank on Penn while going through security when Teller keeps planting a steel ball in one of Penn's coat pockes which makes him cause a scene with the security guards. Afterwords, Penn gets back at Teller by planting a toy gun on him while at the airport and having him detained by security.Penn, Teller, and Carlotta arrive in Philadelphia and take a van to Atlantic City where they check into the Trump Hotel and begin their first show that very night, with the final illusion being Teller strapped to a table and being \"drilled to death\" by overhead power drills.While having dinner with Carlotta at the hotel's restaurant, she tells Penn about her wealthy Uncle Ernesto who is dying from a tumor.

Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, was a stockbroker for Merrill Lynch, and her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (née Finlay), was a homemaker who had worked as a mutual fund marketing executive. Swift was named after the American singer-songwriter James Taylor. She has a younger brother named Austin, who is an actor. Swift spent the early years of her life on a Christmas tree farm which her father purchased from one of his clients. She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori School, run by Franciscan nuns, before transferring to The Wyndcroft School. The family then moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania, where she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.At the age of nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions. She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons. Swift later shifted her focus toward country music inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her \"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything\". She spent her weekends performing at local festivals and events. After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure that she needed to go to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a music career. At the age of eleven, she traveled with her mother to visit Nashville record labels and submitted a demo tape of Dolly Parton and Dixie Chicks karaoke covers. However, she was rejected since \"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different\".When Swift was about 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her how to play guitar and helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading to her writing \"Lucky You\". In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York-based music manager Dan Dymtrow.

Sweden turns out to be far more liberal sexually than the United States. Bob, having met an attractive interior designer, Karin, decides to take her away for a romantic weekend at a mountain resort. JoJo, however, has accepted a similar offer from Erik, who is Bob's new assistant. Originally seen as a respectable suitor, Erik turns out to be a playboy and a cad. A girl thought to be his cousin, Marti, is actually a former girlfriend. Kenny turns up and brings Marti along to the resort, where the three couples continue to awkwardly encounter one another. Kenny finally has his fill of Erik, knocking him out with his guitar. On a voyage home, the ship's captain performs a double wedding ceremony, that turns out to be invalid, due to a navigation error.

On their way to Battle Creek they meet Charles Ossining, hoping to make a fortune by exploiting the fad for health food cereals. Ossining finds a partner in Goodloe Bender. Having enlisted the services of George Kellogg, the doctor's estranged adopted son, they attempt to produce \"Kellogg's Perfo Flakes.\"  In the sanitarium, Will Lightbody is separated from his wife, and is soon harboring lustful thoughts toward Nurse Graves and patient Ida Muntz.

{"instruction": "At present, copyright is ‘automatic’. From the moment an original work is created, the author enjoys all the benefits that copyright protection entails, without the need to complete a registration, deposit the work, mark it with a copyright notice, or comply with any other statutorily prescribed formality. However, the digital revolution has caused a paradigm shift in the way copyright-protected works are created and consumed. Copyright law is now facing significant challenges arising from the need to establish legal certainty over copyright claims, improve rights clearance, and enhance the free flow of information. Inevitably, proposals to introduce formalities in copyright law (or reintroduce them, as the absence of formalities has not always been the norm) have risen to prominence in legal debate.\nThis book examines whether reintroducing copyright formalities is legally feasible. Based on a comprehensive and thorough analysis of copyright formalities, it sets out to establish the extent to which the current copyright system allows for their reintroduction. To this end, the author describes the role and functions of formalities, revisits the history of formalities at the national and international levels, examines the scope of the international prohibition on formalities, and scrutinizes the rationales behind this prohibition, including an in-depth examination of the validity of the argument that copyright is a ‘natural right’ and therefore should be protected independently of formalities.\nThe author skilfully evaluates and contrasts the conflicting theories according to which formalities, on the one hand, add legal certainty to claims on the ownership of property, and, on the other, hamper individual authors from seeking adequate protection for their works. This book makes an important contribution to legal science by answering questions that so far have been neglected or only marginally addressed. To the degree that current copyright law permits reintroducing formalities, the author posits the specifications that will determine to a great extent what role and functions they may eventually fulfil: depending on the aims to be achieved, lawmakers must choose which types of formalities shall be imposed, and what their legal consequences shall be. This book goes a long way towards reinforcing the foundation for those decisions.\nChapter 2. The Role and Functions of Formalities in Intellectual Property Law.\nChapter 3. The History of Formalities in National Copyright Law.\nChapter 4. The Prohibition on Formalities in International Copyright Law.\nChapter 5. Contextualizing the International Prohibition on Copyright Formalities.\nChapter 6. Relativizing the Legal-Theoretical Concerns with Copyright Formalities.\nChapter 7. Summary and Conclusion. Can copyright formalities be reintroduced in a way that balances the need for legal certainty and protection for authors with the free flow of information in the digital age? Discuss the strengths and weaknesses of different arguments for and against reintroducing these formalities.", "instruction_id": "65b7476396093db797840e83dc01d167862bfb625b278077005db9d4eaeebece"}

{"instruction": "Answer based on context:\n\nThe second divisional game of the year for the 3-0 Bears, looking for their first 4-0 start in seven seasons, took place at Ford Field against the 2-1 Detroit Lions. Since 2001, the Bears had won 17 of the meetings between the two, compared to Detroit's 9. The Bears defense, ranked 19th in scoring defense with 24.7 points per game and 25th in yards allowed with 383.0, had to keep up with the Lions' 4th-ranked offense, who recorded 410.7 yards per game 27.3 PPG, sixth in the league. The Lions also had running back Reggie Bush return from a knee injury; Bush had recorded 260 yards and a touchdown in the first two games. However, the Lions' leading receiver Nate Burleson broke his arm in a car accident, which meant additional focus on Calvin Johnson for the Bears. Expectations were for Charles Tillman to cover Johnson, who was limited by Tillman to 15 catches, no touchdowns and an average of 62.3 receiving yards in the last three games. Although Tillman had suffered groin and knee injuries that left him questionable for the game, he was later listed as active against the Lions. However, Johnson recorded 40 catches for 20+ yards in 2012, and the Bears allowed the Steelers to gain 20 yards or more in nine plays. To attempt to combat Johnson, the Bears switched from the pressure defense run in the first three games to the cover 2. In the battle on the line of scrimmage, the Bears had to contain Ndamukong Suh and Nick Fairley, while the Lions had to protect Matthew Stafford from Julius Peppers and Corey Wootton. Offensively, the Bears also had to survive the crowd, who helped the Bears commit nine false start penalties in 2011. Neither team scored a touchdown in the first quarter, instead both scoring field goals, which extended into the first score of the second quarter. Later in the quarter, Matt Fort&#233; scored on a 53-yard run, allowing the Bears to take the 10-6 lead. However, after a David Akers field goal, the Lions would score three unanswered touchdowns, all within 3 minutes, 26 seconds: Micheal Spurlock's 57-yard punt return led to Matthew Stafford's 1-yard run, while Jay Cutler was intercepted by Glover Quin, which set up Stafford's 2-yard pass to Calvin Johnson; finally, the Lions scored after Reggie Bush found a hole and hurdled over Bears' safety Major Wright en route to a 37-yard touchdown. The 27 points scored in the quarter was the most by the Lions since September 30, 2007 against the Bears. The Bears ended the half with a field goal, but continued to trail 30-13. After the Bears kicked a field goal in the third quarter, Cutler was intercepted again, this time by Louis Delmas. However, Chicago regained possession after Stafford's pass to Johnson was kicked and caught by Wright. Three plays later, Cutler was sacked by Ndamukong Suh, and fumbled; the ball was picked up by Nick Fairley, who ran four yards for the touchdown. In the fourth quarter, Akers kicked another field goal to put the Lions up 40-16. Afterwards, the Bears began to mount a charge, with Cutler throwing a 14-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery with less than four minutes in the game, followed by a two-point conversion on another pass to Jeffery. With 43 seconds remaining, a ten-yard pass to Earl Bennett and a two-point conversion off a throw to Brandon Marshall drew the Bears within eight points, but the eventual onside kick was recovered by Lions receiver Kris Durham, allowing the Lions to clinch the 40-32 victory. Statistically, the Bears offense struggled. Cutler completed 27 of 47 passes for 317 yards, two touchdowns, three interceptions and a 65.6 passer rating. Cutler's three interceptions and fumble tied his turnover amount in the first three games. The offense also had trouble on third down; despite being ranked ninth in third down efficiency, the Bears failed to convert until there were 47 seconds left in the game to end the game converting just 1 of 13 third downs.\n\nWho caught touchdowns from Jay Cutler?", "instruction_id": "c4577765cc7da1093ba6c29a137e3f4cbb87d4a7e7af667c30ff26b64b5f8489"}

{"instruction": "When I was 14, out of instinct and desperation, I jumped into a pool of words and started writing. I didn’t know that I would become a writer, only that I needed language to help me find my way, and I needed poetry to save my life. As a teenager filling journals at the speed of sound, I found writing helped me discover, reveal, process, dissect, rebuild and face whatever experiences, situations and perceptions came my way.\nOver the next decade, a round-about journey through several other careers led me back to poetry. By the time I was deeply immersed in earning my doctorate in English, I realized that as a veteran of many creative writing classes, I had developed a wide set of skills as a reader, a writer, and a life-long student of revision. I also knew many people outside the university who wanted to learn more about inventing, drafting, polishing and publishing. So I started offering community writing workshops, thinking people would come to me to study the craft of writing.\nPeople came – not to learn about character development or poetic imagery – but to discover, unearth, explore, recover and often heal something in themselves through writing. Like any good teacher, I followed the lead of my students, and in following, I returned to the source that had made me a writer in the first place: the pool of language where one could seek clarity, understanding, vitality and peace of mind.\nI started facilitating community writing workshops in 1992, and since that time, I’ve been fortunate enough to further explore the therapeutic and transformative potential of writing. I’ve had the honor of facilitating workshops in clinics, writing centers, community centers, schools, universities and colleges, museums, retirement homes, libraries, camps, health centers, and even in the middle of tall-grass prairie.\nI’ve facilitated life writing in the Kansas City Latino community as well as poetry classes for Native American students. A year-long series in Ottawa brought together at-risk teenage girls and elderly women to write, share stories and help one another. For three years, I’ve worked with a group of women in recovery from addiction and abuse at the Lawrence-Douglas County Housing Authority, where I’ve also facilitated “Poetry Camp” for low-income kids, and will soon start “MotherWrites” for young mothers. Through a Native American center, I developed and administered the Midnight Poetry League, which helped teens write, perform and play poetry. I’ve also conducted women’s and men’s workshops as well as sessions for kids from ages five to eighteen. And I’ve presented talks and workshops at conferences and gatherings on how mythology, ecology, history and culture relate to writing for social and personal growth.\nIn recent years, my circle has widened through founding and directing the Transformative Language Arts (TLA) graduate program at Goddard College. TLA draws students from all over the country who are bringing writing, storytelling, drama and other expressive arts to community centers, cancer centers, mental health clinics, businesses, prisons, schools, shelters and hospitals.\nEach workshop session, each exercise always begins with a blank piece of paper and the myriad possibilities of what may come when participants feel safe and encouraged enough to bring to the surface what they have to say in their own voice and their own language. To facilitate this process, all my exercises and approaches are both structured and open-ended, giving participants enough support to take healthy risks and enough freedom to create what comes to them. Most of all, I encourage participants to join together in a supportive community where witnessing the words of others is as important as being witnessed. In learning to listen to each other, participants find common ground and cultivate greater insight, confidence, faith and strength. The creative process itself – with its spirit of experimentation, value of risk-taking, and discovery of new ways to see the world – ripples out into the lives of each and into the community at large.\nIn what settings has the author facilitated writing workshops and what particular communities have they worked with?", "instruction_id": "758b3748f8032c2fa8d1c91607060015561ef1ba23edaae251e03a883e19ac29"}

{"instruction": "You are a teacher of cooking class . You teach middle school students the basics of healthy and safe cooking. The age of your students is 12-16.\n\nWithout the ability to recall & process accurate foundational information, the learning process is futile. You want to support your learners to recall and process accurate foundational information without using quizzes which are proven to only enable short term recall rather than long term memorisation.\n\nInstead, you want to use two instructional strategies proven to increased the effective memorisation of foundational knowledge. The first strategy you will use is known as Undoing.\n\nTopic: Undoing Instructional Strategy\n\nResearch shows that learners learn better & more quickly when the learning experience intentionally challenges commonly mistaken foundational ideas and assumptions and encourages new ways of thinking. The highest impact learning experiences are designed to identify and correct foundational misconceptions before memorisation occurs.\n\nUndoing activities are particularly helpful when used at the start of the learning process by identifying and then correcting gaps in knowledge, misconceptions and misplaced reasoning. Undoing activities often ask learners to predict the outcome of a scenario.\n\nAn example of a well formed undoing activity goes as follows:\n\nSharna is watching a candle burn. Once it’s burned down, she wonders what happened to the wax. She has 4 ideas - which do you agree with most, and why?\nA. XXXX - common misconception\nB. XXXX - a common misconception\nC. XXXX - the correct answer\nD. XXXX - a common misconception\n\nYour task: Using the information above, generate an undoing activity which helps the learners described above to correctly understand core foundational knowledge relating to cooking healthy meals.\n\nWrite feedback for each potential response. The feedback should be succinct and explain the difference between the student's response and the correct answer. It should replace the misconception with an alternative conception, explaining what the alternative, correct way of thinking about the scenario is and how it differs from the student's misconception.\n\nFinally, suggest a resource for the defined learner type to look at which will help them to learn the correct version of the foundational knowledge.", "instruction_id": "547417156eca0d5034e59fc066f81d946e680877485323a88799c43839e68271"}

While using a catching net, she caught 3/5 of the total number of goldfish she was allowed to take home. How many goldfish does Maggie remain with to catch to get the total number she was allowed to take home?\nAnswer: Maggie was allowed to take half of the goldfish in the aquarium, a total of 1 / 2 * 100 = 50 goldfish. On her first catch, Maggie got 3 / 5 * 50 = 30 goldfish. To reach the number of goldfish she was allowed to take home, Maggie has to catch 50 - 30 = 20 more goldfish.

The final price of the Delta flight would come to $850 - $170 = $680. The discount of the United flight would come to $1100 * 0.30 = $330. The final price of the United flight would come to $1100 - $330 = $770. The Delta flight would be cheaper than the United flight by $770 - $680 = $90.

{"instruction": "Light pulses penetrate the skin and are absorbed by the melanin present in the hair. The heat produced by the light destroys the hair follicles, causing the hair to fall out. A course of treatments with the Magma will result in hair removal in one of the most effective and pain-free methods available.\nLaser Lipo Cavitation with ALW3000.\nThis innovative technology to offers the most effective and safe hair removal treatments.\nThe Magma is a precise instrument that can be adjusted to damage only the hair follicle while minimally affecting the surrounding skin. Lasertrolysis is a method of removing unwanted hair, utilizing laser energy targeted to the hair follicle to cause thermal damage and prevent further hairs from growing. The near-infrared laser light is emitted by the ALD applicator and preferentially absorbed by the pigment located in the hair follicle.\nThe laser is pulsed, or turned on, for only a fraction of a second. The duration of each pulse is just long enough to damage the follicle, while the system’s unique contact-cooling system helps protect the skin by conductive cooling during the laser energy delivery.\nThe long wavelength penetrates into the hair follicle causing only minimal epidermal injury. Suitable to be used on all skin types.\nIPL hair removal is an effective and safe hair removal procedure is achieved as Broad-Light spectrum is applied to the surface of the skin, targeting melanin.\nThis light travels through the skin until it strikes the hair shafts or the bulb (root) where the highest concentration of melanin is located. As the light is absorbed, the bulb and most of the hair shaft are heated, destroying the hair-producing papilla. Additionally heat conversion occurs directly in the darker capillaries that bring blood to the follicle.\nAt any one time, not all hair follicles are ‘active’, meaning in Anagen phase and only active hair follicles can be affected by the treatment. ‘Inactive’ hair follicles (e.g. Telogen and catagen) can be treated as they become ‘active’ over time. A series of treatments is required to remove most visible hair.\nCan you provide more information about the Magma hair removal system and how it works?", "instruction_id": "5c1a7ffe6f197caade7a874c0d6c4a12efc02770ae02d6bc40b8221eb1c3f883"}

{"instruction": "Q: In this task you need to give reasons to justify the pronoun coreference relations. Each of the provided inputs contains a sentence with a target pronoun and a question about how to justify the coreference between a noun phrase and the target pronoun. Good practices involve the discussion about how the descriptions attached to the targeted pronoun relate to the noun phrase candidate in the question. The reasoning could come from one or multiple following knowledge types about commonsense: First: 'Property', the knowledge about property of objects (e.g., ice is cold). Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes'). Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10). Sixth: all other knowledge if above ones are not suitable.

In vitro LAL was tested for hemagglutinating activity against rabbit erythrocytes. In vivo LAL was assessed for the anti-inflammatory activity via intravenous injection (i.v.) in Swiss mice (25-30 g; n = 6/group) in models of paw edema and peritonitis.', 'ANOVA (p < 0.05).', 'LAL revealed two bands of 30 and 60 kDa (SDS-PAGE) and exhibited hemagglutinating activity. LAL (10 mg/kg) inhibited the paw edema (77%) and vascular permeability (26%) induced by carrageenan, and the paw edema induced by serotonin (80%), bradykinin (49%), sodium nitroprusside (83%), TNF-α (75%) and PGE2 (64%). LAL also inhibited the neutrophil migration induced by fMLP (70%) or carrageenan (69%). The intravital microscopy showed that LAL inhibited rolling (83%) and adhesion (70%) of leukocytes. LAL anti-inflammatory effect was reversed by its association with N-acetyl-glucosamine.

For instance  single women receiving child support often donât realize they may be able to use the head of household filing status. âThey file as single and they lose a lot of money â says  Michele Cagan  a CPA in Baltimore .\nPeople who recently married or divorced also are especially prone to using the wrong filing status  which results in botched returns  overpaid or underpaid taxes  and other headaches   she  adds.\nâJust because you guys arenât living in the same house doesnât mean youâre divorced for tax purposes â  she  says. âIf your state has legal separation  which not every state does  that counts as divorce for taxes  but otherwise if youâre technically married on Dec. 31  youâre married and you have to file married.â\nSometimes people decide to file their tax returns after the April deadline because they canât afford to pay to the IRS what they owe. Thatâs a huge mistake   Cagan  says. Filing late compounds money problems.\nâThere are pretty big fines and penalties for not filing on time  especially if you owe â  she  warns.\nLate-filing penalties typically cost 5% of your unpaid tax for each month your tax return is late. And late-payment penalties run 0.5% of your unpaid tax for each month your tax payment is late. Thatâs just at the federal level  and it excludes interest. Filing an extension doesnât get you more time to pay   she  says. Itâs just an extension of the time to file.\nThereâs also no reason to procrastinate on preparing your return. âIf you file early  you donât have to pay early. Thatâs another thing people donât know â  Cagan  says. âYou can file early  owe money  and as long as you pay by the deadline  youâre fine.â\nThe rules about who counts as a dependent can be complicated  but one thing is clear: Two people canât claim the same person as a dependent. Divorced couples mess it up all the time  though   Cagan  says. Both parents mistakenly claim the kids as dependents  or neither does.\nâPeople donât talk to each other  because theyâre getting divorced and they donât want to talk to each other â  she  says.\nPeople often use the same tax software version for far too long   Cagan  says. They assume that what worked last year also will work this year. But events such as buying a house  having a baby or getting married can create more-complex tax situations  she says.\nOutput:", "instruction_id": "7175ab3367e589fa2cc18fb224a646f16683b9bbfab1f3073153642dc633cc40"}

If you are still confused, see the following example:\nSo I have a good friend that I enjoy hanging out with, but they aren’t good at turning people down so whenever I invited her somewhere and she doesn’t want to go she says yes and then either constantly reschedules, claims she will get back to me with a time that works for her, or cancels at the last minute with some lame excuse. So would I be an asshole if I confronted her and told her to cut the crap and just be straight with me so that I don’t waste the time and energy trying to make things work if she doesn’t want to go? Also do I have any right to be upset since even though my gut tells me she is just being flaky, she is also a very busy person so there is a chance that I’m just overly sensitive.\nSolution: HYPOTHETICAL\nReason: the author is talking about something he wants to do.\n\nNow, solve this instance: Just want to start off by saying I have high-functioning autism and struggle with what is socially acceptable and what isn’t.\n\nSo I’ve been invited though group text to my uncle’s Easter dinner.

{"instruction": "Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What event does A. Friend recount the details of to Connie?  Connie Wyatt is a restless 15-year-old who is anxious to explore the pleasures of her sexual awakening. Before she enters her sophomore year in high school, she spends the summer moping around her family farm house. She suffers from her mother's put-downs, while hearing nothing but praise for her older sister, June. Her father somehow manages to float around the family tensions. She also helps paint the cottage, just as her mother constantly demands her to. Connie passes the time cruising the local shopping mall with her friends and flirting with boys. When an actual date leads to heavy petting, however, she flees from the boy's car. At a hamburger joint, an older man confides to her, \"I'm watching you!\" and proves it soon after. One afternoon, her mother and June warn Connie to be careful with her flirting, and she is left alone in the house, while her family goes to a barbecue. Later, as Connie is playing around the house, a man who calls himself Arnold Friend approaches her in a 1960s convertible with that name painted on it and identifies himself as \"A. Friend\". He dresses and acts like James Dean, and name-drops several teenybopper acts, even though he is much older than she is. He comes off very kind and friendly, but a bit suspicious, alternating between talking to her in a warm, seductive voice and shouting insults to his fellow car passenger when he asks Arnold if he should \"pull out the phone,\" possibly to keep her from calling the police. Arnold tells Connie about how he has been watching her and that he knows all about her, recounting the details about her family's barbecue plans with amazing accuracy. He then starts talking about how he could be her lover. She starts to get scared and tells him to go, but he coerces her into going with him, threatening to burn down the house, while his friend remains at the house, supposedly to watch over it while they are gone.\nThe answer is:", "instruction_id": "5dd197e093eaf46393ae712a8ac2d8fded7db7f7a475c8c5e10038c07846740f"}

{"instruction": "How do the new ads aim to raise awareness about smoking-related illnesses and suffering, and what resources are available for smokers who want to quit? Answer according to: You probably know that smoking causes lung cancer, emphysema and heart disease. But former smokers want you to know that cigarettes can give you a stroke, make your teeth fall out and cause your baby to be born dangerously early.\nThese are some of the stories featured in the latest batch of \"Tips From Former Smokers\" ads from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The public service announcements will begin appearing nationwide on July 7 and air for nine weeks, the agency said Tuesday.\nPrevious rounds of the ads have been shown to be a cost-effective means of helping people quit smoking. A report last year in the journal Lancet calculated that the initial 12-week campaign in 2012 prompted 100,000 people to kick the habit, at a cost of $540 per quitter.\nIn the new crop, Americans will meet Felicita, who started smoking when she was just 12 (with her mother's permission). Though she quit at age 45, the cigarettes had already caused irreversible gum disease. She would wake up in bed with blood in her mouth and on her pillows. By the time she was 50, all of her teeth had been pulled.\nAlso featured is Amanda, who smoked while she was pregnant. When her daughter was born two months early, she weighed only 3 pounds and had to spend weeks in a neonatal intensive care unit in a clear plastic incubator. \"My tip to you is, 'Speak into the opening so your baby can hear you better,' \" Amanda says.\nThen there's Brian, an HIV-positive man who nearly died of complications from the virus. He kept smoking after he was released from the hospital and wound up having a stroke. \"Dealing with HIV is hard enough, and having HIV is a part of your life until you die,\" he says. \"But smoking is something that you do have control over.... Quitting smoking will be your greatest achievement.\"\nThe new ads were chosen to \"highlight illnesses and suffering caused by smoking that people don't commonly associate with cigarette use,\" Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the CDC, said in a statement.\nOther ads highlight stories of former smokers who developed lung cancer and throat cancer. The ads will direct smokers to call 1-800-QUIT-NOW to find local resources to help them quit. The Affordable Care Act requires health insurance plans to cover smoking-cessation services, usually without any extra fees.\nThe \"Tips\" stories will be seen on television, in movie theaters, on billboards, in newspapers and magazines, and online. They will also air on the radio. Some of the ads will be in Spanish.\nThough fewer than 1 in 5 Americans smokes regularly, smoking remains the No. 1 preventable cause of death and disease in the U.S., according to the CDC. More than 16 million Americans now suffer from some kind of smoking-related disease, and about 480,000 each year die as a result. Smokers rack up $133 billion in medical costs each year, and their health problems result in another $156 billion in lost productivity, the CDC says.\nThe agency's most recent National Adult Tobacco Survey found that 18% of Americans 18 and over used cigarettes on a regular basis. When cigars, pipes, hookahs and other combustible tobacco products were factored in, the figure rose to 19.2%. Men are more likely to smoke than women, as are people with lower incomes and less education and people who are gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender.\nFollow me on Twitter @LATkarenkaplan for more news about science and medicine.", "instruction_id": "b76086bb43b7384fe82d4d009953713a1f7854562fa2c9ecbd03899603af44aa"}

The song sold more than one million copies within five days, earning the Guinness World Record for the fastest selling single on iTunes. It debuted atop the Billboard Hot 100, becoming the 1,000th number-one single in the history of the charts. Its second single \"Judas\" followed two months later, and \"The Edge of Glory\" served as its third single. Both reached the top 10 in the US and the UK. Her music video for \"The Edge of Glory\", unlike her previous work, portrays her dancing on a fire escape and walking on a lonely street, without intricate choreography and back-up dancers.\nGaga hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live in November 2013, performing \"Do What U Want\" (with Kelly) and an album cut, \"Gypsy\". After holding her second Thanksgiving Day television special on ABC, Lady Gaga and the Muppets Holiday Spectacular, she performed a special rendition of \"Do What U Want\" with Christina Aguilera on the fifth season of the American reality talent show The Voice. In March 2014, Gaga had a seven-day concert residency commemorating the last performance at New York's Roseland Ballroom before its closure. Two months later, she embarked on the ArtRave: The Artpop Ball tour, building on concepts from her ArtRave promotional event. Earning $83 million, the tour included cities canceled from the Born This Way Ball tour itinerary. In the meantime, Gaga split from longtime manager Troy Carter over \"creative differences\", and by June 2014, she and new manager Bobby Campbell joined Artist Nation, the artist management division of Live Nation Entertainment. She briefly appeared in Rodriguez's Sin City: A Dame to Kill For, and was confirmed as Versace's spring-summer 2014 face with a campaign called \"Lady Gaga For Versace\".In September 2014, Gaga released a collaborative jazz album with Tony Bennett titled Cheek to Cheek. The inspiration behind the album came from her friendship with Bennett, and fascination with jazz music since her childhood. Before the album was released, it produced the singles \"Anything Goes\" and \"I Can't Give You Anything but Love\". Cheek to Cheek received generally favorable reviews; The Guardian's Caroline Sullivan praised Gaga's vocals and Howard Reich of the Chicago Tribune wrote that \"Cheek to Cheek serves up the real thing, start to finish\". The record was Gaga's third consecutive number-one album on the Billboard 200, and won a Grammy Award for Best Traditional Pop Vocal Album. The duo recorded the concert special Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga: Cheek to Cheek Live!, and embarked on the Cheek to Cheek Tour from December 2014 to August 2015. \nQuestion: What is the full name of Lady Gaga's manager after she split with Troy Carter?\nOutput:", "instruction_id": "594ea3cfc439af83602ccbf310a6901a6ea5a121a7ad1fb0396b23dd779cce3c"}

The coordinates of point A are (1,1) and the coordinates of point B are (6,7).\nTo solve this problem, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm. This algorithm works by maintaining a priority queue of nodes to visit, with the node with the shortest distance from the starting node at the front of the queue. We start by adding the starting node to the queue with a distance of 0, and then repeatedly remove the node with the shortest distance from the queue, updating the distances of its neighbors if a shorter path is found.\nTo apply Dijkstra's algorithm to our problem, we can represent the graph as a matrix where each cell represents a node and the value of the cell represents the weight of the edge between the nodes. We can then use the coordinates of the points A and B to find their corresponding nodes in the matrix and apply Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest route between them.\nWhat is the matrix representation of the graph and the shortest route from point A to point B using Dijkstra's algorithm?", "instruction_id": "9896e7154acec062d207d23cf3c9281ed9eadbe618c2c090f161033e376f7c70"}

{"instruction": "How can Mixed Reality and Augmented Reality be used in the teaching of science, and what advantages do they offer compared to traditional methods? Answer according to: Science and technology go together. It is no coincidence that they are next to one another in the acronym STEM: technology is both a product of science and an essential tool to produce even more scientific advances.\nNowadays, a state-of-the-art science lab is filled with technology, so why should the teaching of science be any different, when a teacher’s aim is to provide a realistic experience that will prepare students for real life application of the skills they have acquired in class?\nThere are plenty of ways technology can be integrated into the science curriculum depending on various factors such as the school’s budget and which branch of science is being studied. Let’s have a closer look at some of the possibilities.\nMixed Reality can give students the chance to interact with virtual versions of places and objects they could not otherwise access: it provides an engaging, hands-on experience that can be applied to any subject and bridge any economic gap, taking students on virtual trips to museums or on a time machine, and science is no exception.\nWhen applied to science, mixed reality is an excellent tool to teach students about that which is too small to see with the naked eye or too big to fit into the classroom: imagine gaining a better understanding of the nucleotides in a DNA strand by examining a three-dimensional model of it you can see through an MR set like Acer Mixed Reality Headset or exploring a simulation of the solar system where planets and satellites are at your fingertips.\nEven without a headset, also Augmented Reality is a tool with virtually infinite potential for educational uses in the STEM field: Acer Chromebook Tab 10 can now support Google’s latest ARCore platform version and other augmented reality apps that can aid the teaching of maths and science by bringing 3D math problems to students’ desks, not to mention a wide range of more exciting possibilities such as miniature volcanoes and imaginary trips to space.\nAnother fundamental aspect of using technology to teach science is that keeping the school’s science lab out of date does not create realistic expectations of what it is truly like to do science today. A curriculum that focuses on teaching science through experiments and data collection instead of relying only on textbooks can benefit immensely from using the latest technological tools to gather and analyse data in greater quantities and with far more precision. A student who has only ever recorded temperatures manually with a thermometer or studied the concept of pH only with universal indicators will find that they have a lot of catching up to do when confronted with a real research lab.\nIntroducing technology into a school lab is not a painless transition: top-of-the-line instrumentation is expensive and can take a toll on the school’s budget, and most importantly, teachers themselves must master its use before they can teach it proficiently, so updating a school’s science equipment is a significant investment in terms of money, time and effort, but just like in any successful investment, for everything that is lost, something more is gained: when applied wisely, the use of technology to teach science is worth the trouble.\nCameras can be attached to microscopes for the whole class to see what is on the slide and record the images for later viewing; data from a physics experiment such as speed and acceleration can be recorded and turned into a handy spreadsheet for further analysis. Even using a mix of analogue and digital tools can be an educational experience: students get to compare the ease and effectiveness of both methods of data collection and, upon finding the inevitable discrepancies, introduce the topic of human error in the scientific process.\nIt is not the easiest road to take, but we cannot deny that a lab equipped with the latest technology makes students into better scientists: it teaches methods comparable to the ones used in real-world research, allows for more in-depth analysis, and keeps them more engaged, potentially fuelling a lifelong interest in science that does not end with graduation and will one day swell the ranks of the next generation of researchers.", "instruction_id": "4fab86bcef41ce12dd1e4095a4dfa656187a6ee4f482db23699658e31b41a17b"}

How much money does Steve take home?\nA: Taxes:40000(.20) = 8000$. Healthcare:40000(.10) = 4000$. Dues:800$. Total:40000 - 8000 - 4000 - 800 = 27,200$. The answer is 27200.\nQuestion: There are 360 balls in the ball pit. If a quarter of the balls in the ball pit are red and a fifth of the remaining balls are blue. How many of the balls are neither red nor blue?\nAnswer: A quarter of the balls are red and therefore there are 360 x (1 / 4) = 90 red balls. When you remove the red balls from the ball pit there are 360 - 90 = 270 remaining balls. A fifth of the remaining balls are blue, and therefore there are 270 x (1 / 5) = 54 blue balls. The total of red and blue balls equals 90 + 54 = 144 balls. When you remove the red and blue balls from the total there are 360 - 144 = 216 balls that are neither red nor blue. The answer is 216.\n[Question]Maya's organization hosted a weekly farmers' market to raise money for the church choir. They sold broccolis, carrots, spinach, and cauliflowers. After adding together all of their earnings, Maya found out that they had made $380. The organization made $57 from broccoli and the sales of the carrots are twice as much as the sales of broccoli. Then, their sales for the spinach is $16 more than half of the sales of carrots. How much did they make from cauliflower sales?\n[Answer]The sales of the carrot is 57 x 2 = $114. Half the sales of carrot is $114 / 2 = $57. So, the sales of the spinach is $57 + $16 = 73. The total sales of the broccolis, carrots, spinach is $57 + $114 + $73 = $244. They made $380 - $244 = $136 from cauliflower sales. The answer is 136.\nQ: Oprah has 3500 cars in her collection. If the average number of cars she gives away per year is 50, how many years will it take to reduce her car collection to 500?\nA: If Oprah wants to have 500 cars left, she will have to give away 3500 - 500 = 3000 cars. Since the average number of cars she gives away per year is 50, it will take her 3000 / 50 = 60 years to give away enough cars to have 500 left over. The answer is 60.\nQuestion: Joyce, Michael, Nikki, and Ryn have a favorite movie. Joyce's favorite movie is 2 hours longer than Michael's movie. Nikki's movie is three times as long as Michael's movie, and Ryn's favorite movie is 4/5 times as long as Nikki's favorite movie. If Nikki's favorite movie is 30 hours long, calculate the total number of hours of their favorite movies together.\nAnswer: Since Nikki's favorite movie is 30 hours long, Ryn's favorite movie is 4 / 5 * 30 = 24 hours long. The total number of hours for Nikki's and Ryn's favorite movies is 24 + 30 = 54 hours long. Nikki's movie is also three times as long as Michael's favorite movie, meaning Michael's favorite movie is 30 / 3 = 10 hours long. Together, Nikki, Ryn, and Michael's favorite movies are 54 + 10 = 64 hours long. If Joyce's favorite movie is 2 hours longer than Michael's favorite movie, then her favorite movie is 10 + 2 = 12 hours long. The length of Nikki, Ryn, Michael, and Joyce's favorite movies is 64 + 12 = 76 hours. The answer is 76.\nQ: Jim buys a wedding ring for $10,000.

Cooper and Durazno knock out a truck driver and steal his rig. They take it back to a shop where it is repainted and the numbers are filed. In it they find a truckload of carburetors. Cooper abandons Durazno at a gas station and sets out as an independent driver of the yellow Peterbilt.

On December 5, a team at LLNL’s National Ignition Facility (NIF) conducted the first controlled fusion experiment in history to reach this milestone, also known as scientific energy breakeven, meaning it produced more energy from fusion than the laser energy used to drive it. This historic, first-of-its kind achievement will provide unprecedented capability to support NNSA’s Stockpile Stewardship Program and will provide invaluable insights into the prospects of clean fusion energy, which would be a game-changer for efforts to achieve President Biden’s goal of a net-zero carbon economy.\n\n“This is a landmark achievement for the researchers and staff at the National Ignition Facility who have dedicated their careers to seeing fusion ignition become a reality, and this milestone will undoubtedly spark even more discovery,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. “The Biden-Harris Administration is committed to supporting our world-class scientists—like the team at NIF—whose work will help us solve humanity’s most complex and pressing problems, like providing clean power to combat climate change and maintaining a nuclear deterrent without nuclear testing.”\n\n“We have had a theoretical understanding of fusion for over a century, but the journey from knowing to doing can be long and arduous. Today’s milestone shows what we can do with perseverance,” said Dr. Arati Prabhakar, the President’s Chief Advisor for Science and Technology and Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n\n“Monday, December 5, 2022, was a historic day in science thanks to the incredible people at Livermore Lab and the National Ignition Facility. In making this breakthrough, they have opened a new chapter in NNSA’s Stockpile Stewardship Program,” said NNSA Administrator Jill Hruby. “I would like to thank the members of Congress who have supported the National Ignition Facility because their belief in the promise of visionary science has been critical for our mission. Our team from around the DOE national laboratories and our international partners have shown us the power of collaboration.”\n\n“The pursuit of fusion ignition in the laboratory is one of the most significant scientific challenges ever tackled by humanity, and achieving it is a triumph of science, engineering, and most of all, people,” LLNL Director Dr. Kim Budil said. “Crossing this threshold is the vision that has driven 60 years of dedicated pursuit—a continual process of learning, building, expanding knowledge and capability, and then finding ways to overcome the new challenges that emerged. These are the problems that the U.S. national laboratories were created to solve.”", "instruction_id": "06a35a2094361360a5a37d5598b7f467f46a39c23b4ab570b912aff9a5de3e4f"}

{"instruction": "In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate label \"True\" if abstract is structured, otherwise generate \"False\". A structured abstract is composed of a topic sentence (or key sentence), relevant supporting sentences, and a closing (or transition) sentence. This structure is key to keeping your abstract focused on the main idea and creating a clear and concise image.\nOne example: RanBP type proteins have been reported to increase the catalytic efficiency of the RanGAP-mediated GTPase reaction on Ran. Since the structure of the Ran-RanBP1-RanGAP complex showed RanBP1 to be located away from the active site, we reinvestigated the reaction using fluorescence spectroscopy under pre-steady-state conditions. We can show that RanBP1 indeed does not influence the rate-limiting step of the reaction, which is the cleavage of GTP and/or the release of product P(i). It does, however, influence the dynamics of the Ran-RanGAP interaction, its most dramatic effect being the 20-fold stimulation of the already very fast association reaction such that it is under diffusion control (4.5 x 10(8) M(-1) s(-1)). Having established a valuable kinetic system for the interaction analysis, we also found, in contrast to previous findings, that the highly conserved acidic C-terminal end of RanGAP is not required for the switch-off reaction. Rather, genetic experiments in Saccharomyces cerevisiae demonstrate a profound effect of the acidic tail on microtubule organization during mitosis. We propose that the acidic tail of RanGAP is required for a process during mitosis.\nSolution is here: False\nExplanation: Output is appropriate for the given abstract because it is not structured.\n\nNow, solve this: BACKGROUND Androgens play a critical role in the growth of both androgen dependent and castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Only a few micro-RNAs (miRNAs) have been suggested to be androgen regulated. We aim to identify androgen regulated miRNAs.   \n METHODS We utilized LNCaP derived model, we have established, and which overexpresses the androgen receptor (AR), the VCaP cell line, and 13 intact-castrated prostate cancer (PC) xenograft pairs, as well as clinical specimens of untreated (PC) and CRPC. The expression of miRNAs was analyzed by microarrays and quantitative RT-PCR (Q-RT-PCR). Transfection of pre-miR-141 and anti-miR-141 was also used.   \n RESULTS Seventeen miRNAs were > 1.5-fold up- or downregulated upon dihydrotestosterone (DHT) treatment in the cell lines, and 42 after castration in the AR-positive xenografts. Only four miRNAs (miR-10a, miR-141, miR-150*, and miR-1225-5p) showed similar androgen regulation in both cell lines and xenografts. Of those, miR-141 was found to be expressed more in PC and CRPC compared to benign prostate hyperplasia. Additionally, the overexpression of miR-141 enhanced growth of parental LNCaP cells while inhibition of miR-141 by anti-miR-141 suppressed the growth of the LNCaP subline overexpressing AR.   \n CONCLUSIONS Only a few miRNAs were found to be androgen-regulated in both cell lines and xenografts models. Of those, the expression of miR-141 was upregulated in cancer. The ectopic overexpression of miR-141 increased growth of LNCaP cell suggesting it may contribute to the progression of PC.\nSolution:", "instruction_id": "696d2a17a232012065b59e7adde65b2ab191bcf3b700bebe4fc9cf7db029c7c0"}

Prepare this information in the form of a table: Event in one column, Astrological combinations and reasoning on the second column. Here is the writeup to process: In 1905 Nehru sailed for England when he\nwas having Rahu Bhukti in Ketu Dasa. Mark the positions of these two\nplanets in Rasi and Navamsa. Venus Dasa Venus Bhukti (1912) saw\nhim back in India—a Politically quiet and dull India that offered no scope\nfor the aggressive nationalism that the youth had already imbibed.\n\nHe settled down to the practice of law (Mercury, Sun, Venus and Mars\naspecting the 12th, indeed a powerful combination) which offered\npossibility of a brilliant future but fate-rather, luck ordained otherwise.\nNehru married in 1916. Kalatrakaraka Venus was responsible for this.\nKetu Bhukti in Venus Dasa saw him as President of the Indian National\nCongress—a great honour and also a great responsibility. Venus is in\nthe 4th having caused a powerful Rajayoga while Ketu is in the 6th—the\nsub and major lord being disposed in the 3rd and 11th from each\nother—an ideal combination. With the commencement of the Sun Dasa\nNehru's popularity began to wax further. The Sun is in a Keeta Rasi. He\nis a political planet. He aspects the 10th house. In the Navamsa he is\nwith Saturn. The commencement of the Sun Dasa therefore saw him in\nprison. Jawharlal's father died during Rahu Bhukti in Sun Dasa. Rahu\naspects Jupiter, lord of the 9th and the major lord Sun is Pitrukaraka.\nThe sub-lord is in the 8th from Pitrukaraka. Again the end of Rahu\nBhukti in Sun Dasa saw Nehru in jail. His release took place in Sun\nDasa Venus Bhukti (1935). In the same period, his wife died. The major\nlord Sun owns the 2nd (family) in Rasi and the 7th in Navamsa. The\nsub-lord is of course Kalatrakaraka. Between themselves they are in the\n2nd and 12th from each other. His last detention took place in Moon\nDasa Mercury Bhukti. Both the major and sub-lords are hemmed\ninbetween malefics, the sub-lord owns the 3rd and 12th and is in\nconjunction with the lord of the 11th. Rahu was then transiting radical\nSaturn being the 2nd from the Moon. Mars is a yogakaraka and he\naspects the 10 house powerfully. \n\nAs soon as his Dasa began, Nehru\nbecame the Vice-President of the Indian Interim Government. Though\nRahu is in the 12th, his disposition from Mars is very significant with the\nresult the influence of the major lord prevailed and Nehru became India's first\nPrime Minister. The end came in Ketu's sub-period in the major period\nof Rahu.", "instruction_id": "b418934c6348025fd28dd411ab0471489871fa6b00565af14192011ac40d2122"}

{"instruction": "[Question]Due to a drought, Jerry's household can only use 1000 gallons of water during July. Jerry uses 100 gallons for drinking and cooking and 20 gallons per shower. He wants to fill his pool, which measures 10 feet by 10 feet by 6 feet. If each gallon of water fills 1 cubic foot of the pool, how many showers can Jerry take in July?\n[Answer]First find the total volume of the pool: 10 feet * 10 feet * 6 feet = 600 cubic feet. This is also the number of gallons he needs to fill the pool. Subtract the pool water and the drinking and cooking water from the total amount of water Jerry is allowed to use: 1000 gallons - 600 gallons - 100 gallons = 300 gallons. Then divide the amount of water Jerry has left to use for showers by the amount of water per shower to find how many showers he can take: 300 gallons / 20 gallons / shower = 15 showers. The answer is 15.\n\n[Question]Alissa used discarded paper to make notepads for her friends. She would fold 5 pieces of letter-size paper 3 times then cut along the edges to form smaller note papers. She would then stack these smaller note papers and staple them together.

So 5 pieces of letter - size paper make 5 × 8 = 40 pieces of note - size paper. 1 note pad would last 40 ÷ 10 = 4 days if someone wrote 10 notes a day.

And glad I did tho I received just the single disc and I see that the Blu Ray and  Digital version are offered at the same price.I watched the extended version which has many excellent scenes that were deleted.  Most of them were great and shouldn't have been removed from the theatrical version whose beginning 45 minutes just dragged on and on. This extended version really improves things for me.  The extra scenes of prehistoric encounters really were wonderful and the styragosaurs scene was actually an homage to the 33 original who also had a similar scene that was cut out and lost.  There was only one scene towards the end, which contained an army officer in a truck of solders( don't want to spoil it so I am not saying what happens in this scene) that I thought could have been left out; seemed really cheesy to me.I'm not into book reports so here's my take on the transfer quality only.  Get it.  The video is quite outstanding...beautiful color saturation and shading, wonderful depth throughout.  No grain, no artifacts, nothing to take away from  the demo transfer quality that this is.The audio is DTSHD 5.1 and, in many parts, is also demo worthy.  There really is an expansive sound stage and perfect directionality from the discreet speakers when appropriate.Unless you don't like the movie itself, there is no reason not to have this King Kong on blu ray.All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.Thanks\nquestion: What's the greatest scene?\nOutput:", "instruction_id": "15342da2a3542ea109dd3be25525ebac64b93e700245e4b8c7f298e785116c79"}

{"instruction": "Detailed Instructions: Determine if the provided SQL statement properly addresses the given question. Output 1 if the SQL statement is correct and 0 otherwise. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows.

{"instruction": "Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\"\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source... Why were a lot of Midlanders out of work? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. people were going back to school to learn open source  B. OpenAdvantage was hiring all the workers  C. not enough information  D. industry was being automated and moved to Asia\nThe answer to this question is:", "instruction_id": "111f4c2e4125dbb61d20adc91786dcc9111a4ea72c43036d5f757de7e78261c5"}

{"instruction": "It would have to be this… Donald Trump once cashed a $0.13 check… In 1990, writer from a “Spy Magazine” had a great idea for a prank: “What would happen if you sent checks for small amounts to celebrities and saw who cashed them, putting to test the theory that every man (and woman) has a price? In their words: \"We could however, send them checks for minuscule sums of money—sums so small they couldn’t fund as much as a minute of the recipients’ existence—and see who would bother to bank these teensy amounts of money.\" Spy thought \"some subterfuge\" would be necessary—it'd be suspicious to get a check from the magazine that lampooned so many of the intended recipients. This was specifically true for Trump, who Spy once famously referred to as a \"short-fingered vulgarian.\" So, they created a fully funded and incorporated company called National Refund Clearinghouse, which allowed them to open a checking account. Then they drafted a letter explaining that the check was a refund for a small overcharge that had occurred in 1988—what the celebrities had been overcharged for was never mentioned. They sent the checks out (initially for $1.11) to 58 well-known people like Cher, Henry Kissinger, and, of course, Donald Trump. Of the 58, 26 cashed the checks—Donald included. The magazine drafted a followup letter and checks for $0.64 to those 26 people to see who would take more free money. Thirteen—including Donald Trump—deposited the checks worth two quarters, a dime, and four pennies into their banks. Then they went for one last score: in honor of those 13 people, 13 more checks for $0.13. Two people cashed them: a Saudi arms dealer named Adnan Khashoggi, and Donald Trump. Seriously.” I really don’t know if this is the most “cheapskate” thing, on just CRAZY fiscal responsibility. But if I had to pick, this would get my vote… resources: Splinter - The truth hurts Question: What was sent to the celebrities? === The answer to the above question is\n\nSelect from the following. -something very personal and private. -something very rare. -not enough information. -something with very small value.\nAnswer:", "instruction_id": "bb86182fb4b678a0c1fde3e92af02eb77e28ca317cbfa58dafba1e122aacd85e"}

{"instruction": "The desire for a permanent connection across the Limfjord at Aggersund dates back to the early 1900s. In the mid-1920s, citizens in Løgstør reduced a selection, which appeared with a number of suggestions for a bridge. However, the initiative stranded controversy about the alignment and funding. In 1936, the idea was resumed by the Ministry of Employment and Social Affairs and the Ministry of Transport as a possible employment measure, and in 1939 the construction of the bridge, which was funded by Aalborg, Hjørring and Thisted Amter, began. The bridge was projected by Christen Ostenfeld. The initiation took place on 18 June 1942. The bridge cost about 3.5 million DKK. During the German occupation of Denmark, the bridge was strategically important for the German shipments of crew and equipment to and from Norway. Therefore, a military support point was built in 1943-44, consisting of 11 concrete plants on the north side and 6 on the south side. In addition, minefields and other types of barriers were introduced. Two large Flak bunkers on the south side and one on the north side are still available and are available. The other smaller bunkers have either been removed or located in a private area without public access. In 2000, the Aggersund Bridge beams were strengthened, increasing the carrying capacity of the bridge.

Originally developed as a shorter, lower-cost twin-engined airliner derived from Boeing's 707 and 727, the 737 has developed into a family of nine passenger models with a capacity of 85 to 215 passengers. The 737 is Boeing's only narrow-body airliner in production, with the -700, -800, and -900ER variants currently being built. A re-engined and redesigned version, the 737 MAX, is set to debut in 2017. Originally envisioned in 1964, the initial 737-100 made its first flight in April 1967 and entered airline service in February 1968 at Lufthansa. Next, the lengthened 737-200 entered service in April 1968. In the 1980s Boeing launched the -300, -400, and -500 models, subsequently referred to as the Boeing 737 Classic series. The 737 Classics added capacity and incorporated CFM56 turbofan engines along with wing improvements. In the 1990s Boeing introduced the 737 Next Generation with multiple changes including a redesigned wing, upgraded cockpit, and new interior. The 737 Next Generation comprises the four -600, -700, -800, and -900 models, ranging from 102 ft to 138 ft in length.\nSolution:", "instruction_id": "952c67d19e989972dc535a0c9daeb03af15035fe9150856c73a62faf6e3ffd61"}

Question: What do you do if there's a fire and the friends answer? Title: What To Do In Case Of Fire Movie plot: The sound of a film reel rolling accompanies credits appearing jerkily on the screen, as if displayed by an old film projector. As the credits continue, voices and clanking sounds are heard. One says \"Camera - rolling!\" and another follows with \"Group 36 Training Film.\" After some more fumbling sounds, the training film begins. A crude map of Berlin in 1987 appears, filmed by an unsteady camera. A narrator, one of the previously heard voices, explains that Allied occupation forces rule the city, and almost every squat has been evacuated. Only one block remains: Machnow Street, zip code SO36, in the American sector. The film then gives way to footage of a crowd of jeering people in a run-down neighborhood. They begin to throw objects at a line of police holding riot shields. For a moment, the camera freezes, and the film's title, \"Was Tun, Wenn's Brennt?\" (What to Do in Case of Fire?) appears on the screen. Then the rioters rush the line of policemen, jumping on cars, screaming, and generally causing mayhem. The camera focuses on some of the rioters, whose names appear onscreen, introducing Tim (Til Schweiger) and Flo (Doris Schretzmayer). A water cannon, a huge, tank-like vehicle equipped with a high-pressure water hose, begins to rumble down the street. Its spray knocks down several rioters, and they begin to flee. Rioters with signs continue to mock the policemen. Two more new characters appear in the same way as the others, Maik (Sebastian Blomberg) and Nele (Nadja Uhl). Another, Terror (Matthias Matschke) urinates on the policemen from an upper-story window. Yet another, Hotte (Martin Feifel), leads a mob down a street, waving a flag bearing the symbol for anarchy. All the while, the rioters are heard shouting in the streets. The narrator begins to speak again, informing viewers that Machnow street residents live in terrible conditions. A female voice adds that they are always inebriated or on drugs. More voices chime in that these people commit vandalism, resist arrest, and are misguided and sexually...\nAnswer:", "instruction_id": "0952a994178d861e02b9db6dba7dae00c6159f681b5c48e7455b30fada4940a0"}

{"instruction": "Q: I read this background article the other day: Something that is elastic can return to its original shape after being stretched or compressed. This property is called elasticity . As you stretch or compress an elastic material like a bungee cord, it resists the change in shape. It exerts a counter force in the opposite direction. This force is called elastic force . The farther the material is stretched or compressed, the greater the elastic force becomes. As soon as the stretching or compressing force is released, elastic force causes the material to spring back to its original shape. You can watch a demonstration of elastic force at this URL:  I am facing a new situation today: An inventor named Nelly is tinkering around in her home office where she has created two new types of material that could be used in products. The first one she is calling Glubber, and the second she has named Malk. To try to figure out what type of products these new materials may be used for, Nelly is performing various tests. The first test she is doing is securing one end of the material to a table and then pulling on it and letting it go. When she performs this test on some Glubber, the material quickly snaps back toward the table. Performing the same process with some Malk, the material slowly crawls along the floor as it makes its way back to the table.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which material is less resistant to changing shape?\nA: Malk\n\nQ: I read this background article the other day: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature.  I am facing a new situation today: Two friends liked studying about the Earth's atmosphere. Vick studied more about the troposphere, while Frank studied more about the Greenhouse Effect.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which friend studied less about carbon dioxide?\nA: Vick\n\nQ: I read this background article the other day: Windbreaks reduce wind velocity over and around crops.

Hill farm started installing windbreaks, while Valley farm didn't have the funds to do that so they postponed the project.

For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.

{"instruction": "Problem: Labour Party (UK):\n\nAs it was founded by the unions to represent the interests of working-class people, Labour's link with the unions has always been a defining characteristic of the party. In recent years this link has come under increasing strain, with the RMT being expelled from the party in 2004 for allowing its branches in Scotland to affiliate to the left-wing Scottish Socialist Party. Other unions have also faced calls from members to reduce financial support for the Party and seek more effective political representation for their views on privatisation, public spending cuts and the anti-trade union laws. Unison and GMB have both threatened to withdraw funding from constituency MPs and Dave Prentis of UNISON has warned that the union will write \"no more blank cheques\" and is dissatisfied with \"feeding the hand that bites us\". Union funding was redesigned in 2013 after the Falkirk candidate-selection controversy.\n\nWhat spokesman said the union is happy with Labour?\n---\nA: unanswerable\n\n\nProblem: where a single prime denotes the real part and a double prime the imaginary part, Z(ω) is the complex impedance with the dielectric present, Ccmplx(ω) is the so-called complex capacitance with the dielectric present, and C0 is the capacitance without the dielectric. (Measurement \"without the dielectric\" in principle means measurement in free space, an unattainable goal inasmuch as even the quantum vacuum is predicted to exhibit nonideal behavior, such as dichroism. For practical purposes, when measurement errors are taken into account, often a measurement in terrestrial vacuum, or simply a calculation of C0, is sufficiently accurate.)\nHow is the complex impedance with dielectric represented mathematically?\n---\nAnswer: Z(ω)\n\n\nQ: What is a question about this article? If the question is unanswerable, say \"unanswerable\".\nSometimes overlooked during his life, James Lind, a physician in the British navy, performed the first scientific nutrition experiment in 1747. Lind discovered that lime juice saved sailors that had been at sea for years from scurvy, a deadly and painful bleeding disorder. Between 1500 and 1800, an estimated two million sailors had died of scurvy. The discovery was ignored for forty years, after which British sailors became known as \"limeys.\" The essential vitamin C within citrus fruits would not be identified by scientists until 1932.\nHow many sailors died from scurvy between the years 1500 and 1800?\nA: two million\n\n\nContext and question: Following (or leading up to) the schisms, each Saṅgha started to accumulate an Abhidharma, a detailed scholastic reworking of doctrinal material appearing in the Suttas, according to schematic classifications. These Abhidharma texts do not contain systematic philosophical treatises, but summaries or numerical lists. Scholars generally date these texts to around the 3rd century BCE, 100 to 200 years after the death of the Buddha. Therefore the seven Abhidharma works are generally claimed not to represent the words of the Buddha himself, but those of disciples and great scholars.[note 38] Every school had its own version of the Abhidharma, with different theories and different texts. The different Abhidharmas of the various schools did not agree with each other. Scholars disagree on whether the Mahasanghika school had an Abhidhamma Pitaka or not.[note 38]\nThere is a disagreement on whether a school had an Abhidhamma or not, which school is it?\nAnswer: Mahasanghika\n\n\nQuestion: By 1820, Charleston's population had grown to 23,000, maintaining its black (and mostly slave) majority. When a massive slave revolt planned by Denmark Vesey, a free black, was revealed in May 1822, whites reacted with intense fear, as they were well aware of the violent retribution of slaves against whites during the Haitian Revolution. Soon after, Vesey was tried and executed, hanged in early July with five slaves. Another 28 slaves were later hanged. Later, the state legislature passed laws requiring individual legislative approval for manumission (the freeing of a slave) and regulating activities of free blacks and slaves.\nIs there an answer to this question: What revolution made whites fearful of retribution of slaves?\n\nAnswer: Haitian Revolution\n\n\nQUES: In these schools children could be selected on the basis of curriculum aptitude related to the school's specialism even though the schools do take quotas from each quartile of the attainment range to ensure they were not selective by attainment. A problem with this is whether the quotas should be taken from a normal distribution or from the specific distribution of attainment in the immediate catchment area. In the selective school system, which survives in several parts of the United Kingdom, admission is dependent on selection criteria, most commonly a cognitive test or tests. Although comprehensive schools were introduced to England and Wales in 1965, there are 164 selective grammar schools that are still in operation.[citation needed] (though this is a small number compared to approximately 3500 state secondary schools in England). Most comprehensives are secondary schools for children between the ages of 11 to 16, but in a few areas there are comprehensive middle schools, and in some places the secondary level is divided into two, for students aged 11 to 14 and those aged 14 to 18, roughly corresponding to the US middle school (or junior high school) and high school, respectively. With the advent of key stages in the National Curriculum some local authorities reverted from the Middle School system to 11–16 and 11–18 schools so that the transition between schools corresponds to the end of one key stage and the start of another.\n\nIn what year were comprehensive schools first closed?\nWhat is the answer?\nANS:", "instruction_id": "d977608b7b341dbbee433ac0e9e1bc4f2912c024a7afd2f1804cf962fc8f37b8"}

After only a few minutes in the microwave, I looked up from what I was doing in the kitchen and noticed flames and a black cloud in my microwave. I cut the power and opened the door and found that there were two burned out holes on both sides of the slope of the kettle's hood, and two corresponding protrusions through the plastic on the underside of the hood. My microwave was covered in soot, and the acrid smell of burned plastics filled my kitchen.I see that this product is being sold at other retailers online. My recollection is that I picked mine up at the Black & Decker outlet store.Do not purchase or continue to use this unsafe product. The website for the manufacturer is [...] (located in Kent, WA).

Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?\nNegative\nQ: Title: Minor Latin Master Review: I bought this CD because I love the Guarnieri Symphonies performed and recorded by the same team. I'd never heard of Mignone before.Imagine if Respighi had lived in Brazil. (Respighi did, in fact, write a Brazilian piece after touring there). The Italian-born Mignone wrote in a similar vein. He was a deft orchestrator, the music is bright and enjoyable, not rhythmically or harmonically complex but orchestrally very sophisticated. The notes claim an African influence in the music, but this is true only in a Hollywood sense; it's far from the essence of Africa heard in the music of Kevin Volans, for example. Still, Hollywood has its place, and this record is good fun. If you enjoy the Criolla Cantata by Antonio Estevez (recorded by Mata on the Dorian label) you'll adore Mignone's choral ballet Maracatu de Chico Rei.This CD is well played and brilliantly recorded, as you'd expect from a BIS production. It's a guilty pleasure! Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?\nA: Positive\nQuestion: Title: Excellent debut Review: The other raving reviewers have it right -- this is a fabulous album. King of the World will stick in your head for weeks, and the rest of the album pleases as well. Still listenable after nearly 2-1/2 decades. It's a shame the Katydids didn't go further; they really were one of the great, underappreciated bands of the era. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment?\nAnswer: Positive\n*Question*\nTitle: Excellent Learning Tool Review: This book is part of a series that is an effective tool for expanding one's vocabulary. It requires that the student find and learn definitions on his own, and then apply them to various activities, including Fill in the Blank and Choosing the Right Word exercises. A pronunciation guide at the beginning of the book allows a student to complete the pronunciation drill included in every section. This way, the student does not only know the meaning of the word, he knows how to use it properly in dialog. Another excellent feature of this book (and series) is that the author groups words with similar meanings in the same groups so that the student will be able to distinguish between the two when faced with real material. Overall, this book and series thereof are terrific centers of vocabulary curricula and will greatly benefit students and teachers alike.

{"instruction": "Can you make this 500 words? As a child, I loved Bob the Builder, but if anything, I was his opposite, clumsily breaking everything from serving bowls and vases to my brother’s meticulous LEGO starships. My parents and brother unanimously agreed: I had the rare “reverse Midas touch.” Coming from a family of engineers, I was supposed to be naturally good at fixing things. Instead, it quickly proved to not be the case.\n\nWhile I may not have had high mechanical precision, my favorite TV show showed me that building means so much more. It taught me to love building in other, equally important ways: building communities by bringing people together and using innovation and imagination to solve challenging problems in the world.\n\nOne such area that I’ve been interested in working in is edtech. After witnessing the world around me fracture under social isolation, I set out to build YAPA Kids, an organization of high school volunteers dedicated to teaching and inspiring young students. What started simply as a way for me to support a few students quickly reached more of those eager to learn. I realized then the power that technology could have in not just bringing educational access but inspiring younger students to explore their curiosities. Now, I’m engaging with the Collins Institute, a cutting edge educational organization, working to develop personally tailored educational experiences enhanced by AI tools. Technology often takes a long time to permeate the educational space, but the potential is unlimited, and I am excited to continue exploring applications in this area.\n\nI’ve also seen first-hand the impact that technologies that AI are able to have, as a builder. My nature is to tinker, even if I break things, and with machine learning, it’s been no different. Having developed independent projects such as applying NLP topic and sentiment classification to email and computer vision/CNNs to 3D MRI scans, I resonate with the mission and vision of the Technology Innovation Fellows program in seeking to create a community of builders. This past summer, I worked as a Product and Engineering intern at a growth-stage fintech startup, Grata, pioneering the use of deep learning and NLP to make sense of the messy, complex financial information in the world and make it searchable. Being part of a fast-moving company creating innovative products opened my eyes to just how quickly impact can scale and makes me eager to develop the business expertise to do the same with my life.\n\nEqually important, I believe it is important to be involved in the policy and government perspective on technology. In a rapidly advancing world, generalist policymakers will need more and more advanced technology perspectives and government policy is routinely slow to keep up. I’m currently taking a Gov seminar on disruptive technologies and international relations, and have separately spearheaded a white paper on large language models as a research project. My interest in understanding where technology leads us led me to apply for the Harvard Yun Fellows for Revolutionary Thinking program, where I conducted a year-long project into the effects of artificial intelligence on the workforce and economy.\n\nI believe in the power of communities to shape the world. The lack of enough conversation around AI on campus led me to co-found the Harvard AI Group, affiliated with HCS, as a way to create conversation about AI and allow for exchange of ideas. Now, we’re engaging 160+ members in events focusing on the impacts of AI on society, government, and technological advancements. And in just a few weeks, we’re planning to release free access to GPT-4 to the Harvard community to bring the latest technology to campus as one of our latest initiatives.\nThe Undergraduate Technology Innovation Fellows program shapes a broader community of builders, innovators, and students pushing into the realm of imagination in so many interesting directions. For many years, I’ve been involved in learning about technology and its applications, but I want to dive deeper into how I can pursue this entrepreneurial approach to the broader professional world, education, and policy.\n\nThrough this program, I aim to find ways to leverage the newfound potential of technologies including AI to create positive impact in the world, and hope to learn and contribute my experiences as an engaged member of the ongoing conversation on technology at Harvard.", "instruction_id": "f82006a0a406b5bc634b6ad137fa61e93088c152344b82ba6a7939d2e50d5a55"}

{"instruction": "Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I have a chronic illness, and so I received quite a few sterling gems in the months between onset and accurate diagnosis. I had one GP — let’s call him Dr Douche. I promise, it’s the kindest way I could describe him. “The jacket means I know things.” He came up with wilder and wilder theories as to why I was sick, and kept getting sicker. It should be said beforehand that few of these theories were embodied. He was sure it was something in my ladybrains that was preventing proper function of the rest of me. Dr Douche said so much weird, wild, and just-plain-unbelievable crap over the course of my diagnosis that someday I may create a novel that incorporates it all. But this here has to be the blue ribbon winner. I was describing a symptom to him: every time I got up in the morning, when I first stood, my heart would pound, my heart rate would accelerate, and I’d feel dizzy. After a few probing questions — (only in the morning? — no, but it’s worst in the morning)… “Maybe,” he said sensitively, “you’re afraid.” “Of standing?” I asked, just to be sure. “You think I’m afraid of… standing up.” Maybe he meant there was some kind of existential fear, like, we’re all afraid, it’s a big old universe out there, and he wanted some comfort and reassurance. Nope. The man genuinely thought I had such a profound fear of verticality, that I was having a near-panic in response to being upright. POTS, folks. It was POTS. Literally THE most common sign/symptom/syndrome of autonomic dysfunction. The most common one. He could’ve confirmed right there in the office with a poor man’s tilt table test, if he knew to… Mayo Clinic had to confirm with expensive instruments because he’d never heard of a disease that affects 1/100 teenagers and between 1–3 million people in the United States!

So frankly, when the trend for flouncy ruffles started to bubble, it struck fear into many a minimalists heart. Thankfully this isn't about rewinding to the '80s hey-day of giant frilly dresses. Instead, designers have given us options. And there are a few lessons to be learnt in how to wear these ruffles well. On paper, pink and ruffles should have been too sickly sweet to make the cut. But in reality A Détacher's designer Monika Kowalska has managed to make a very modern, simple dress. Tick. Karl's turned the pretty dial up to eleven with this lacy number. Black boots and tights keeps the dress from being too bridal. Who would have thought it, pure girly frills in lilac and peach are literally the best combination. Like Karl, black accessories keep it from getting too Sandra Dee. Silky flamenco ruffles, cut out shoulders and a skirt slashed to the thigh banishes any feeling that frills mean frump. The Rodarte sisters have a particular brand of 'gothic romanticism' that walks the perfect line between gritty and girly. Case in point, their leather frilly jacket. Grey jersey is given new life with a smattering of frills at Stella. But if you try it at home, this much fabric calls for a pointed heel. The 1980s were arguably the glory days for the ruffle. Valentino's 'ra-ra skirt' dress gives a nice little nod to the decade but thankfully there are no leg warmers in sight.

Thurlow suggested that \"the most reliable estimates\" were those produced by the anti-fascist investigatory magazine Searchlight (magazine). Following its establishment, the NF claimed to have 4000 members in 1968, and in February 1974 a branch chairman claimed that it had 20,000 members. Fielding suggested that it probably had about 21,000 members in early 1975, of whom 6,000 to 8,000 were \"paper members\" who had not renewed their membership subscriptions but not officially terminated their membership. Searchlight claimed that from its origins with 4,000 members in 1968, the party reached a peak membership of 17,500 in 1972, which had declined to 10,000 in 1979, to 3,148 in 1984, and to 1,000 in January 1985. An estimate of party membership in 1989 put adherents of the Flag Group at about 3,000 and of the Strasserite faction at about 600. Thurlow noted that even at its peak in the 1970s, the Fronts membership was still only half the size of that of the BUF during its 1930s heyday.\nQuestion: What year was the membership, according to the  of the Searchlight, for the Front closest to the membership total of the Flag Group in 1989?\nStudent:", "instruction_id": "d3f0cba877d2e3d64fcf429e6dc04837d6cadb751274cdad47de82d60b6838e3"}
{"instruction": "For the given English description, write an SQL command such that it accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \"SELECT\" statement. Next, you use a \"FROM\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \"AS\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \"AS\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \"JOIN\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \"ON\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \"WHERE\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \"GROUP BY\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \"HAVING\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \"ORDER BY\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \"DESC\" statement will sort in descending order and the \"ASC\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \"LIMIT\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \"*\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.\nOne example is below.\nQ: Did M0 's star , director , art director , producer , and cinematographer direct M1 and direct M2 , M3 , and M4\nA: SELECT count(*) WHERE {\n?x0 ns:film.actor.film/ns:film.performance.film M0 .\n?x0 ns:film.cinematographer.film M0 .\n?x0 ns:film.director.film M0 .\n?x0 ns:film.director.film M1 .\n?x0 ns:film.director.film M2 .\n?x0 ns:film.director.film M3 .\n?x0 ns:film.director.film M4 .\n?x0 ns:film.film_art_director.films_art_directed M0 .\n?x0 ns:film.producer.film|ns:film.production_company.films M0\n}\nRationale: The query correctly extracts data on M0's star and other persons related to M0 and finds if they appear in director attributes for entities M1 to M4\nQ: Did M0 marry M5 , M6 , and M7 , influence M1 , M2 , and M3 , and influence M4\nA:", "instruction_id": "10e1ca265be90cb9844e2dd6c2698ee69d56f5b5827c67075574ec7173069fd8"}

{"instruction": "Information:  - Zalmoxis  is a divinity of the Getae and Dacians (a people of the lower Danube), mentioned by Herodotus in his \"Histories\" IV, 9396.  - The Danube (, known by various names in other languages) is Europe's second-longest river, after the Volga River, and also the longest river in the European Union region. It is located in Central and Eastern Europe.  - See Kogaionon ( genus ) for the mammal from the Upper Cretaceous . Kogaionon was the holy mountain of the Geto - Dacians , the place where Zalmoxis stayed in an underground cave for three years . After his disappearance into Kogaionon , he was considered dead by the Getae but after three years he resurrected and showed himself to the people , who became convinced by his holy preaching when he emerged from Kogaionon . Strabo claims that a river with the same name flowed in the vicinity . One modern translation of Kogaionon is `` sacred mountain '' , which would be connected to a probable Dacian word kaga meaning `` sacred '' , attested in two early 2nd century inscriptions from Tomis . Kogaionon 's location is still under debate , but thought to be either in the area around the Dacian capital Sarmizegetusa Regia ( there is a 2291m summit there called Gugu and there are speculations that it could be the holy mountain ; it may also have been Dealul Grditei where the ruins of the sanctuaries of Sarmizegetusa are located ) or even the Ceahlu mountain , because every year on 6/7 August the shadow of the mountain forms a pyramid which is thought to have been made by the Dacians .  - The Getae or or Gets (singular ) are several Thracian tribes that once inhabited the regions to either side of the Lower Danube, in what is today northern Bulgaria and southern Romania. Both the singular form \"Get\" and plural \"Getae\" may be derived from a Greek exonym: the area was the hinterland of Greek colonies on the Black Sea coast, bringing the Getae into contact with the Ancient Greeks from an early date. Several scholars, especially in the Romanian historiography, posit the identity between the Getae and their westward neighbours, the Dacians.  - Herodotus (\"Hródotos\") was a Greek historian who was born in Halicarnassus in the Persian Empire (modern-day Bodrum, Turkey) and lived in the fifth century BC (484 425 BC), a contemporary of Socrates. He is widely referred to as \"The Father of History\" (first conferred by Cicero); he was the first historian known to have broken from Homeric tradition to treat historical subjects as a method of investigationspecifically, by collecting his materials systematically and critically, and then arranging them into a historiographic narrative. \"The Histories\" is the only work which he is known to have produced, a record of his \"inquiry\" (or \"historía\") on the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, including a wealth of geographical and ethnographical information. Some of his stories were fanciful and others inaccurate; yet he states that he was reporting only what was told to him and was often correct in his information. Despite Herodotus' historical significance, little is known of his personal history.    'kogaionon' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'country'?

Limantour proposed an end to the hostilities and offered an amnesty for all revolutionaries , the resignation of the then vice president Ramón Corral , the replacement of four Díaz cabinet ministers and ten state governors by ones chosen by Madero , and the establishment of the principle of  no @-@ reelection  which would prevent Díaz from seeking yet another term as president ( which would have been his ninth ) . Madero responded positively although he also stated that any kind of peace deal had to include an immediate resignation by Díaz . Faced with the siege of Ciudad Juárez and the outbreak of rebellion in Morelos , Díaz and members of his cabinet became more willing to negotiate and launched a skillful peace offensive  aimed at Madero . This was largely a result of panic among the large landowners associated with the Díaz regime ( the hacendados ) and the financial elite , which represented a  moderate  wing within the government . Some among the Porfiristas in fact , expected that Zapata would soon march on Mexico City itself , unless peace was concluded with Madero . The moderate view within the Díaz government was represented by Jorge Vera Estañol who in a memo to the minister of foreign affairs wrote that there were two revolutions taking place in Mexico : a political revolution , based mostly in the north , whose aim was mostly to establish free elections and remove Díaz himself from power , and a social revolution whose aim was anarchy  which was spreading throughout the Mexican countryside . Estañol recommended coming to terms with the first group of revolutionaries , by agreeing to the principle of no re @-@ election and a general amnesty , in order to prevent the second group from succeeding . In addition to his fear of  anarchy  , Estañol was also worried that the social revolution would lead to a military intervention by the United States . Estañol 's views represented those of the portion of the upper class which was willing to come to terms with at least a portion of the middle class in order to crush the peasant uprisings , as exemplified by those of Zapata , which were erupting throughout Mexico . Limantour , who broadly agreed with Estañol , had the support of the Mexican financiers , who feared the downgrading of Mexican international credit and a general economic crisis as a result of ongoing social unrest , as well as that of the large landowners who were willing to come to terms with Madero if it would put an end to the agrarian uprisings . These social group were in turn opposed by the more reactionary elements within Díaz 's government , mostly concentrated in the federal army , who though that the rebels should be dealt with through brute force . This faction was represented by General Victoriano Huerta , who would later carry out an attempted coup d 'état against Madero . Likewise , the general , and potential successor to Díaz , Bernardo Reyes stated in a letter to Limantour that  the repression ( against the insurrectionists ) should be carried out with the greates energy , punishing without any pity anyone participating in the armed struggle  . In the end however , Díaz dismissed the advice from his generals as Custer @-@ like bluster  and chose to seek peace with the moderate wing of the revolution . Limantour had finally managed to persuade him to resign . At the same time there was also disagreement among the rebels . The  left wing  of the revolutionary movement , represented by Zapata and Orozco ( Villa for the time being tended to support Madero ) , warned against any possible compromises with Díaz . In the end their suspicions proved correct as the treaty that was eventually signed neglected issues of social and agrarian land reform that were central to their struggle . fill in the blank  : As early as March 1911 , Madero 's __________________ met in New York with Díaz 's finance minister , José Yves Limantour , and the Mexican ambassador to the US in order to discuss the possibility of peace between the two sides .

{"instruction": "Who were the top contenders in the 1984 U.S. Open golf tournament, and how did they perform?: Fuzzy Zoeller, 32, shot 67 and defeated Greg Norman in an 18-hole playoff. Norman shot 75. By shooting 276 for the 72 holes, Zoeller and Norman became the first men to be under par in four Opens played at Winged Foot Golf Club, in Mamaroneck, New York. Par is 280. The lowest previous score was 282 by Billy Casper in 1959. Norman and Zoeller finished five strokes in front of Curtis Strange of Kingsmill, Virginia, whose 69-70-74-68-281 would have won any previous Open at Winged Foot.\nJohn Miller, the 1973 Open Champion and Jim Thorpe shared fourth at 282 while Hale Irwin, who led for most of the first three rounds, shot 79 on the final day and finished sixth at 284. In the first round 18 players bettered or equaled par. Irwin and Thorpe at 68 shared the lead with Hubert Green, the 1977 Champion and Mike Donald. Steve Ballesteros, Strange and Jay Sigel, 1982 and 1983 United States Amateur Champions were at 69, with Norman at par 70. Irwin, 39, added 68 and led after 36 holes with 136 but Zoeller shot 66, the lowest round ever during an Open at Winged Foot, to stand at 137. Norman had 68 for 138 along with David Canipe. Both Irwin and Zoeller shot 69 in the third round; Irwin led by a stroke at 205 and Norman and Thorpe had 207.\nWhile Irwin and Thorpe faded in the fourth round, Zoeller and Norman pulled away. Zoeller holed consecutive birdie putts of 20, 22, 20 and 15 feet on the third through sixth holes, gaining five strokes on Irwin and, by then, only Norman and Zoeller were in contention. Zoeller led by three strokes with nine holes to play, but Norman pulled even at the 17th and saved par on the 18th by holing a 45-foot putt after hitting his approach into a grandstand and being given relief without penalty.\nAfter both men birdied the first hole of the playoff, Zoeller birdied the second from 68 feet and gained three strokes when Norman made 6. Zoeller made the turn in 34 and led by five strokes - went ahead by seven on the 14th, by eight after 15 holes, and by nine after 16. Norman's birdie at 17 trimmed the margin to eight. Siegel, a contender for 36 holes and Richard Fehr were low amateurs. Arnold Palmer missed qualifying after playing in 31 consecutive Opens. He is tied with Gene Sarazen for the most consecutive Opens played.

{"instruction": "Canada has one of the most secretive financial systems in the world, according to a new report, less transparent than Russia and China, and offshore tax havens like Cyprus, Bermuda, and Barbados.\nThe Tax Justice Network (TJN) — an independent international research and advocacy network focusing on tax evasion and tax havens — released its Financial Secrecy Index on Tuesday.\nThe index, produced every two years, measures the extent to which a country’s legal system facilitates global financial crimes such as money laundering and tax evasion.\nCanada is No. 21 on the list, slightly higher than its 2016 ranking at No. 23. The higher the ranking, the more financially secret a country is.\nThe report comes two years after the Panama Papers, and two months after the Paradise Papers — two massive document leaks revealing a pervasive network of offshore tax havens that fuels financial corruption and organized crime, and deprives public coffers of $10 to $15 billion each year in Canada alone.\nAn ongoing Star/CBC investigation into corporate ownership secrecy has detailed how Canada has emerged as a popular destination for international companies and individuals seeking to avoid or evade taxes by using this country’s shadowy corporate registration system.\n1) Lack of transparency: There is no national public registry naming the real people behind Canadian companies, and no obligation on financial institutions to reveal the beneficial owners of a company.\n2) Lack of substance: You can create a corporation in Canada which has no substance, said Rizqy, and functions, essentially, as a shell company.\n“While we’re seen as a clean image globally, that clean image sometimes overshadows the secrecy that happens in our own corporate sector,” said James Cohen, director of policy and programs for Transparency International Canada.\nPart of the problem, Cockfield said, is the benefits of this type of illicit financial activity. The Star/CBC investigation showed how corporate secrecy has led some people from countries such as Russia, Mexico and China — countries less financially secret than Canada, according to the index — to use Canada to “snow wash” money that has either been obtained illicitly or not declared to tax authorities.\n“Players like Germany and Canada don’t necessarily get the attention from the international community they deserve for being final resting places for dubious money,” said James Henry, an investigative economist with Yale and Columbia Universities and the TJN.\nWestern countries like the U.S. and Canada, for example, have rule of law and independent courts, which, said Henry, make it possible for wealthy members of third world countries to hold their money anonymously.\nAccording to the Global Financial Secrecy Index, Switzerland, the U.S. and the Cayman Islands are the biggest tax havens in the world.\nCountries are assessed by a criterion that measures whether corporations are required to reveal their true owners, whether annual accounts are made available online and the extent to which countries comply with international anti-money laundering standards.\nAnother factor is the size of a country’s financial system and the size of its offshore activity.\nThis year’s index shows that “the global haven industry is alive and well,” Henry said. Based on the passage above, Can you provide a summary of the Tax Justice Network's Financial Secrecy Index report and where Canada ranks in terms of financial secrecy?", "instruction_id": "58fc5ccd51f9b3c8c30c9730e4448a9dec71569162a11419fda1a8ace6644bb4"}

{"instruction": "Please summarize this essay: Early in my career as a math educator, I was teaching a medium-sized college statistics course and I was a little surprised at how poorly my students did on the first exam that semester. I decided to take a little class time and ask my students how they went about studying for that exam, and a number of students in this class of size 50 or 60 volunteered their strategies.\nSome students said they looked over the problem sets that they had turned in and I had graded and handed back. Other students mentioned reading through the relevant sections in the textbook, maybe for the first time. And still other students talked about making use of the notes they had taken during class sessions. I added all of these strategies to a list on the board and then polled my students to see which strategies were most common.\nI don't remember the results of that poll, but what I do remember is that not a single student suggested the study strategy I would have recommended them to use: Find some relevant math problems they hadn't already attempted and try to solve those problems, ideally checking their work somehow and getting help on any problems they missed. That would most closely approximate the exam situation itself, where students would need to solve math problems they hadn't seen before.\nLater, I would come to understand a lot about why this study strategy is way better than the ones suggested by my students. I would learn about concepts like retrieval practice, which says the more we try to retrieve information from our brains, the more that information will stick in those brains, and transfer, which is the process by which we apply what we know in new situations, something that only gets better with practice. There's lots of research around these ideas that supports my recommended math study strategy as a smart one.\nAt the time, however, I was surprised at all these bright, hard working students who seemed to just not know about a better way to study for math exams. Now, maybe a few students actually studied this way and just didn't feel comfortable sharing that in a room of dozens of their peers. But it was a clear a lot of students hadn't thought to try their hand at new math problems as they studied for the exam.\nNot only did I tell my students about my recommended study strategy that semester, but I also started helping students adopt it by providing review guides for each of my exams. Each review guide would suggest a number of problems from the textbook that were on-topic for the exam, usually ones with correct answers listed in the back of the book so that students could check their work. And I directed my students to my office hours as a great place to get help with the practice problems they got wrong or didn't fully understand. Helping my students adopt this strategy didn't mean every one of them passed my exams with flying colors, but it definitely helped more students learn the materials and do better on those exams.\nIf you're a college student, you may be wondering now if you're missing out on some study strategy that could help you learn and succeed in your courses. There's no secret strategy that will guarantee success, mainly because learning is hard work no matter how you go about it, and particular strategies may very by course and discipline and topic. However, there are some general principles (like the need to practice retrieval and transfer) that will help in any learning context.\nWe'll spend some time exploring those principles and how to use them in future newsletters, but for now, know that it's probably useful to question your study strategies a little. And it might be really useful to reach out to your professors and ask them how they think you should study for your exams. It's pretty easy for college professors to assume their students know stuff they don't, and this is the kind of question that can be very useful to ask.", "instruction_id": "1973872e4a5d2c791ee4e3aee4521f7fe8d4655ed12721eea7e799492807ee6d"}

Eventually he filed more than 400 lawsuits representing more than 13,000 clients, leading the company to agree to a settlement in July worth a cool $51 million.\nMcDonald wouldn’t talk about the settlement with the Star-Telegram, citing an agreement with Chesapeake. While some of his clients were paid from a few hundred dollars to several thousand, McDonald and another law firm hit a big payday, getting about $20 million in legal fees.\nChesapeake and its partner in the Barnett Shale, Total E&P USA, didn’t exactly roll over. They fired back with their own high-dollar experts and won some legal victories in court, including a decision that the judge was apparently going to limit the years of natural gas production covered by the lawsuits.\nSince July, McDonald has been resolving the lawsuits involving roughly 1,100 clients. A long list of them were dismissed in November. Some of the holdouts eventually settled with Chesapeake while others simply said no or couldn’t be found. Only a handful the cases remain.\nBut the settlements weren’t the end of the story.\nFirst of all, McDonald and his co-counsel, Circelli, Walter & Young, parted ways in October, over how to represent the remaining clients after “stark differences” over strategy, tactics, approach and “litigation philosophy” emerged, according to court records.\nMaking matters worse, McDonald and Circelli were sued by Jim Ward, a lawyer who claimed McDonald cheated them out of millions in attorney fees for work he did on the case. A judge allowed Circelli to drop out of the cases, and Ward’s lawsuit was eventually dismissed.\nSo, was McDonald’s legal crusade and populist movement worth it?\nLem Miller, a real estate agent in Coppell with leases on an old family dairy farm near Cleburne that includes seven wells on 160 acres, is frustrated.

J.B. Pritzker  has a boil on  his  neck the size of Cook County Assessor Joe Berrios.\nActually  it is Joe Berrios  as if Joe just walked out of the Erie Cafe after a nice veal chop. Now  he âs sitting on  his  patch of  Pritzker  for all voters to see.\nJoe might as well just light a cigar and wave to the cameras filming those anti-Pritzker political ads.\nBut  Pritzker  the billionaire running for governor in the March 20 Democratic primary   doesnât want to touch this.  He  wonât go near it.\nBerrios  who is also the Cook County Democratic Party chairman (by grace of Boss Madigan)  backs  Pritzker . And so  Pritzker  isnât engaging the thing that stares property tax-paying homeowners right in the face.\nKennedy has long made the property tax system  and the corruption in it  a feature of his campaign. He has called on Berrios to resign.  Pritzker  and  his  ally Mayor Rahm Emanuel would rather change the subject and talk about the guy in the White House.\n âPritzker  talks about things that arenât really the issue.  He  talks about Donald Trump  but  he  skirts the issue of using Joe Berriosâ office to call political supporters.  Pritzkerâs  locked in with those guys.â\nMost recently  reporter Jason Grotto âs  excellent series âThe Tax Divideâ â published in June in the Chicago Tribune and continued this month in collaboration with ProPublica â has laid bare much that is wrong with the property tax assessment system in Cook County:\nAs Kennedy  along with Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner and his GOP primary opponent  state Rep. Jeanne Ives  demand Berriosâ head on a pike  pressure increases on Joeâs friends  like  Pritzker .\n Pritzker  has money.  He âs built a statewide political organization. If  he  can satisfy the media by issuing proclamations against Trump  why should he fight on Kennedyâs ground?\nGalia Slayen  the communications director for the Pritzker campaign  notes that  Pritzker  has publicly called out the property tax system. And  she says  the criticisms of her candidate are unfounded.\nFair enough. But  Pritzker  isnât running against Rauner now.  He âs not running against Donald Trump either.\n He âs running for the Democratic nomination against Chris Kennedy  and property taxes will be the issue. And they will be the issue in the general election.\nYet  he  avoids any mention of Berrios  who maintains the system  or Madigan  who benefits  and who can snap  his  fingers and have Joe come running.\n Pritzker  has a serious weakness in all this beyond the Berrios on  his  neck.  His  ham-handed decision to seek a property tax reduction for  his  Gold Coast neighborhood mansion will revisit  him .\n He  bought the house next door and had the toilets removed so it would be declared an uninhabitable dwelling. Then  he  got a tax break of nearly $230 000 for living next to it.\nOutput:", "instruction_id": "d6883e3aa50b18d846fd448a9f3cff2f77d31a5d6d89149dce2306ae232e3161"}

{"instruction": "Detailed Instructions: Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation. Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no.\nQ: Is OTHER wrong in the post ? POST : For the background: i'm a physically disabled 19 year old and I live with my roommate, 21 and able bodied. Originally we would take turns with the chores (the 2 chores in question are the dishes and taking out the trash). So when she took out the trash, I would do the dishes, when she does the dishes I take out the trash. The problem was, she would get irritated at me for being too slow with the dishes or using up the hot water or generally not being done with the things she wanted by the time she wanted to cook. Why I mentioned I am physically disabled is because that's the reason I am slow with them, it wasn't on purpose. Poor coordination and weak legs, I had to stop earlier than most so I wouldn't collapse or break one of the dishes by dropping it.\n\nSo we came to an agreement she'd always always do the dishes if I always always take out the trash (since then, I've also taken on the responsibility of sweeping, mopping, and cleaning the counters though she'll do it on an occasion. The reason I've taken on these 3 additional tasks is because, \"dishes are so stressful. It's fair if you do more chores\"- most of the time, they're her dishes, not mine anyways).\n\nAnd I was fine with taking out the trash although at times it was painful because it was heavy, I have a disability, and it is a bit of a walk. The dumpster I have to take the trash bags to are a half of a block to a block away but, I'd get it done. However, there was 1 term &amp; condition. That I wouldn't take it out after night without her walking with me because I get really scared and paranoid being outside alone. \n\nThis was all fine and we worked like this for a while, until I returned from winter break (I spent half of December and a week of January outside the state with family). When I returned, I noticed that she would clean her room almost immediately after I took out the trash, causing the trash to be almost full if not completely full often the night of or day after taking out the trash. She would get upset at me if I complained though my complaining was because, as I said, it can be a bit painful, it's a long walk, and I had JUST taken out the trash the day before. I didn't want to do it again.\n\nI told her once when I was about to take out the trash and checked with her if her room was clean, thinking this could resolve things but instead she just snaps at me and tells me how clean her room is, is none of my concern. I think it is my concern because I have to take out her trash.\n\nI've also asked her several times to Not clean out her room immediately after I took out the trash so that I don't wake up and see it almost full after I had JUST taken it out. I told her if she wants to fill up a trashbag full of her trash, she can take it out herself. This didn't stop her either, except cause some arguments. Now she fills up plastic shopping bags and shoves it into the trash bag but it still fills it up to over half way full.\n\nShe also complains about the smell sometimes, but she's the one that is tossing in raw meat scraps usually a day or two after I take out the trash when its mostly empty (if it's stayed mostly empty). I rarely cook raw meat btw, because I don't have the energy, I live off of pasta, microwaveable meals, and sometimes a \"frozen meat entree\" whenever I have the money.\n\nSo this is where my question comes in.\n\nLast night she took out the trash because it was dark out and I hadn't done it; she got frustrated that it wasn't taken out and did it herself. Today its already full, barely any of the trash is mine, but I know she's expecting me to take it out today. I know if I take it out, I won't be standing my ground and that she will possibly yell at me BUT id be willing to do it tomorrow after classes.\n\nSo, AITA for not wanting to take it out today?\n\nand AITA for refusing to take out the trash roughly a day or two after I had JUST taken it out, refusing only because she decided to fill it up after cleaning her room which I asked her to do, multiple times, before I take out the trash, not after?\nA:", "instruction_id": "831aa5fc7e2991cf51213a472d45be454bcfbe0eaed1b154051a8a5e614efc86"}

Given an utterance and recent dialogue context containing past 3 utterances (wherever available), output Yes if the utterance contains the small-talk strategy, otherwise output No. small-talk is a cooperative negotiation strategy. It is used for discussing topics apart from the negotiation, in an attempt to build a rapport with the opponent. For example, discussing how the opponent is doing during the pandemic or sharing excitement for the camping trip.\nPart 2. Example\nContext: 'Great!  So looks like all the water goes to you.  I will take all the food if that is ok and we can split the wood.  ' 'Well i would need one food and one wood' 'OK.  I think that will work out for me.  You get 3 water, 1 wood and 1 food.  I will take the rest.'\nUtterance: 'Great that's an agreement for me'\nAnswer: No\nExplanation: The participant does not engage in any small talk in this utterance and primarily refers to the negotiation itself.\nPart 3.

{"instruction": "Detailed Instructions: In this task you are given an anecdote. You must find out whether the anecdote is something the author has done or is considering doing. Label the instances as \"HISTORICAL\" when the author has already done something and label them as \"HYPOTHETICAL\" when the author is considering doing something in the future.\nSee one example below:\nProblem: So I have a good friend that I enjoy hanging out with, but they aren’t good at turning people down so whenever I invited her somewhere and she doesn’t want to go she says yes and then either constantly reschedules, claims she will get back to me with a time that works for her, or cancels at the last minute with some lame excuse. So would I be an asshole if I confronted her and told her to cut the crap and just be straight with me so that I don’t waste the time and energy trying to make things work if she doesn’t want to go? Also do I have any right to be upset since even though my gut tells me she is just being flaky, she is also a very busy person so there is a chance that I’m just overly sensitive.\nSolution: HYPOTHETICAL\nExplanation: the author is talking about something he wants to do.\n\nProblem: So I'm kinda pissed off at a certain sub. It's for professionals in a certain field. \n\nThis field is very lucrative - starting salaries of around 60-70K out of undergrad and very common career trajectories of around 150K by age 35 (obviously not everyone). \n\nAnyways, so this subreddit does a few really annoying things. \n\n1. Some people think they're better than everyone else, including other people on the sub. Especially people who are still in college for this field. They act as if they understand everything and they are incredibly harsh with their words. \n2. Some people think they're poor as fuck. They would post comments like \"I got a 70K salary and the salary is so laughable and disgraceful.\" But it always has a tone of humblebragging - they know they are successful and capable, but they still act like they're not. \n\n\nObviously #1 is just the regular egotistical asshole. But #2 is what truly pisses me off. They are completely undermining everyone else. I chose this field, I make a lot of money, and I know that. I don't deny it and I'm incredibly grateful for it. I know I live a privileged life and none of my success is possible without the rest of society. I don't look down on anyone making less, and I don't up to anyone making more. \n\nThese people who are humblebragging are literally dragging down other professions such as teachers, environmentalists, nurses, biologists, and more. I mean we are in a field that literally gets money handed to us after undergrad, as long as your GPA is okay. \n\nI see my friends, people smarter than myself, go to nursing school and environmental graduate school and I see them saving lives. While I won't change my own career because frankly I like money and financial stability, I know that they deserve more than me. I wish they earned as much as I did, really. \n\nSo it pisses me off to no end that this subreddit is treating it like shit. \n\nThat being said, I think I might be an asshole if I make the post because I would be telling others how to live their lives and how to think. I am appreciative of other professions that help the world, and I feel that those professions make way too little money. But that's my worldview, and I don't expect other people to have the same worldview. \nSolution:", "instruction_id": "aa5b4e54c057dcb6930c3ab7ce05d10c318a2cfa68875255a639c24c9219ce0b"}

{"instruction": "Given the text: Ready to Reduce Your Monthly Payments?\nHow can tankless water heaters help reduce your monthly bills?\nA long day at work or getting an early morning start, each day ends and begins with the use of hot water, and tankless water heaters provided the best method of assuring your family has all the hot water they’ll ever need. A tankless water heater is more efficient than a standard water heater, with a flow as necessary way of heating water. Rather than heating water throughout the day and night, hot water is only provided when it is being used. This saves money on energy. Tankless water heaters, also called a demand-type water system are the future of efficient water heating. Old water sitting in the water heater can become rusted but a tankless heater prevents this problem.\nFamilies have the problem of running out of hot water, by providing hot water when required these units provide lots of hot water. In some households, hot water is in demand for multiple things so having an extra tankless unit may make it easier to supply hot water needed for a families needs. These containers can last as long as 20 years. Fortunately, replaceable parts increase the longevity of these units. They heat as much as 2 to 5 gallons per hour, standard hot water heaters only last 10 to 15 years. Safety mechanisms are installed to stop excessively hot water from running out of your tap.\nWith proper installation, there is always hot water for household task. Cold water flows through pipes and heats as it flows. This supplies plenty of water for laundry, showers and dishes. By adding a maintenance agreement to a tankless unit, our service department can keep it at top operating efficiency. Choose a value model or a more expensive tankless.\nFor families using a pronounced amount of hot water a tankless water heater can save almost 50% of their standard us of energy on heating water. Continuous pilot lights using gas can waste energy but the use of an intermittent pilot on a gas-heated unit saves energy waste. Having enough hot water to cover the needs of your family makes daily activities more convenient. These water heaters are also space savers and store in convenient places.\nGet back control of your Birmingham home!

{"instruction": "What is the role of insurance commissioners and state insurance departments in regulating the insurance industry at the state level?: With automobile insurance prices on the development throughout the previous five decades, I am always asked who is accountable for automobile insurance sector regulation and what people can do about the increasing prices to cover their vehicles. The solution is not just straightforward, but it’s extremely important for customers to understand who and what affects their insurance prices — and also what they can do about it.\nYou hear it sometimes in the information. The order issued by the insurance commissioner — and also the notice of noncompliance issued another month for failing to execute the arrangement shows government regulation in actions.\nWhy is the insurance industry regulated?\nThe easy answer would be to protect consumers from unfair price increases and to make certain that insurance businesses remain financially solvent in order that they can cover claims as they appear.\nWho’s responsible for controlling the insurance market?\nA collaborative effort between legislators, insurance providers, and yes, customers, keeps the business in check.\nThe reality is the U.S. Constitution makes it impossible for a national agency to mandate or control auto insurance. Both of these entities basically collect data and data from insurance companies and advise state labs in their findings. They supply oversight, but don’t have any ability to control insurance laws.\nIf the federal government is not the watchdog regulating the insurance business, who’s?\nFinally the regulation of automobile insurance companies and prices is set by each individual nation.\nBy way of instance, some nations, such as California, Hawaii, and Massachusetts, don’t let insurers operating in their countries to utilize credit as a element in determining prices. In states like Arizona, the Department of Insurance requires representatives to offer you a $0 glass allowance to clients buying a”full policy ” coverage because windshield damage brought on by sand and stones is so typical in that environment.\nWho manages the insurance industry regulation in the country level?\nInsurance commissioners, in addition to the guidance of state insurance departments, are basically the sheriffs from the Wild West of the insurance market. The insurance commissioner of every state is appointed by the Senate or voted into office in state-specific voting periods and is responsible for tracking insurance firms’ compliance with state laws.\nWhen an insurance carrier is operating beyond its legal responsibility in a specific condition, it’s up to the insurance division (and more especially the insurance commissioner) to intervene and evaluate penalties, fines, as well as refunds to clients when premiums are billed incorrectly. Including what insurance companies are permitted to utilize as score factors to ascertain pricing, for example charge , highest degree of schooling, and home ownership.\nAssuming insurance businesses comply with their individual state regulations, then they compute what to bill customers for their unique premiums utilizing complex score calculations. They are companies, so that they must pay taxes, salaries, and other expenses to keep their doors open, and naturally they are working to make a gain in a few of the very competitive markets.\nWhat does this mean mean for customers? We do not get to see precisely how every individual insurance company computes rates, but state regulatory sections do, thus we should all stay educated about what variables may be utilized in these calculations so we are able to discover the policy, support, and pricing which suits our distinctive needs.\nBesides state insurance departments, insurance companies are also governed by the marketplace where they function. Insurance companies are in business to generate money; not shed it. This competitive marketplace can be useful to consumers should they shop around and compare prices regularly. If companies begin losing clients because their prices are too large, they might need to fix or risk going out of business entirely. Just be certain you’re still getting the service and coverage you require, also.\nYou might even do it to decrease your auto insurance rates by calling your district agent or your own state’s insurance division. Elected officials are public servants and respond to the people they represent, therefore sending a letter or making a telephone call to your agent could lead to changes in insurance laws.", "instruction_id": "f816c42c00c3d236bfd8c27a1163bceeef29c986c2e697819eb3bdf95f93714a"}

The Ozarks cover a significant portion of southern Missouri, extending as far northeast as the southwestern suburbs of St. Louis. In Arkansas, a large portion is contained within the northwestern and northcentral region. Much smaller pieces of the Ozarks extend westward into northeastern Oklahoma and extreme southeastern Kansas.  - The tallgrass prairie is an ecosystem native to central North America. Natural and anthropogenic fire, as well as grazing by large mammals (primarily bison), were historically agents of periodic disturbance, which regulates tree encroachment, recycles nutrients to the soil, and catalyzes some seed dispersal and germination processes. Prior to widespread use of the steel plow, which enabled conversion to agricultural land use, tallgrass prairies expanded throughout the American Midwest and smaller portions of southern central Canada, from the transitional ecotones out of eastern North American forests, west to a climatic threshold based on precipitation and soils, to the southern reaches of the Flint Hills in Oklahoma, to a transition into forest in Manitoba.   - Richard Hanson ( born February 20 , 1940 ) served as secretary of state of Missouri in 1994 following the removal from office of his predecessor , Judith Moriarty . A Democrat from Cole County , Hanson served on an interim basis in 1994 from the time of Moriarty 's removal from office by the Missouri Supreme Court following her impeachment by the Missouri House of Representatives until Governor Mel Carnahan appointed Bekki Cook to serve until the following scheduled election for the office .  - The Mississippi River is the chief river of the largest drainage system on the North American continent. Flowing entirely in the United States (although its drainage basin reaches into Canada), it rises in northern Minnesota and meanders slowly southwards for to the Mississippi River Delta at the Gulf of Mexico. With its many tributaries, the Mississippi's watershed drains all or parts of 31 U.S. states and 2 Canadian provinces between the Rocky and Appalachian Mountains. The Mississippi ranks as the fourth longest and fifteenth largest river in the world by discharge. The river either borders or passes through the states of Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana.  - Missouri (see pronunciations) is a state in the Midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1821. With over six million residents, it is the eighteenth most populous state and host to the mean center of United States population. The largest urban areas are St. Louis, Kansas City, Springfield, and Columbia. The capitol is in Jefferson City on the Missouri River. The state is the twenty-first most extensive by area and is geographically diverse. The Northern Plains were once covered by glaciers, then tallgrass prairie, and now the deep soils yield great agricultural productivity. In the South are the Ozarks, a forested highland, providing timber, minerals, and recreation. The Mississippi River forms the eastern border of the state, eventually flowing into the swampy Missouri Bootheel.  - St. Louis is an independent city and major U.S. port in the State of Missouri, built along the western bank of the Mississippi River, on the border with Illinois. The city has an estimated 2015 population of 315,685, and is the cultural and economic center of the Greater St. Louis area (home to 2,916,447 people), making it the largest metropolitan area in Missouri and the 19th-largest in the United States.  - Judith K. Moriarty (born February 2, 1942) is an American politician from Missouri, first with the Democratic Party, switching to the Libertarian Party in 2005. She was the first woman to serve as Missouri Secretary of State.  - The Missouri Bootheel is the southeasternmost part of the state of Missouri, extending south of 36°30 north latitude, so called because its shape in relation to the rest of the state resembles the heel of a boot. Strictly speaking, it is composed of the counties of Dunklin, New Madrid, and Pemiscot.

{"instruction": "In a national park, the number of redwoods is 20% more than the number of pines. If there are 600 pines in the national park, calculate the total number of pines and redwoods that are there. Give the rationale and then the answer.\nLet's think step by step. If there are 600 pines, there are 20 / 100 * 600 = 120 more redwoods than pine trees in the national park. In total, there are 120 + 600 = 720 redwoods in the national park.

{"instruction": "Given a passage with a context and an answer, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage. Construct the question in such a way that (i) it is unambiguous, (ii) it is answerable from the passage, (iii) its answer is unique (iv) it answer uses text phrases from the passage. Avoid creating questions that (i) can't be answered correctly without actually understanding the passage and (ii) uses the same words or phrases given in the passage.\n\nLet me give you an example: Context: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogeneous disease with an uncertain pathogenesis. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 ± 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03). ILC2s were also correlated with worsening nasal symptom score in CRS (P = 0.04).\nAnswer: As ILC2s are elevated in patients with CRSwNP, they may drive nasal polyp formation in CRS. ILC2s are also linked with high tissue and blood eosinophilia and have a potential role in the activation and survival of eosinophils during the Th2 immune response. The association of innate lymphoid cells in CRS provides insights into its pathogenesis.\nThe answer to this example can be: Are group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) increased in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or eosinophilia?\nHere is why: The question is based on the following sentences from the two passages (i) Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) {ii) In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (iii) As ILC2s are elevated in patients with CRSwNP, they may drive nasal polyp formation in CRS. and (iv) ILC2s are also linked with high tissue and blood eosinophilia.\n\nOK. solve this:\nContext: An imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission underlies the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia. Agonists of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors, mGluR2/3, have been proposed as novel therapeutic agents to correct this imbalance. However, the influence of mGluR2/3 activity on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors has not been explored.', 'We aimed to investigate the ability of a novel mGluR2/3 agonist, LY379268, to modulate the availability of the excitatory N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) and the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyrate-A receptor (GABAA-R), in a two-hit mouse model of schizophrenia.', 'Wild type (WT) and heterozygous neuregulin 1 transmembrane domain mutant mice (NRG1 HET) were treated daily with phencyclidine (10 mg/kg ip) or saline for 14 days. After a 14-day washout, an acute dose of the mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 (3 mg/kg), olanzapine (antipsychotic drug comparison, 1.5 mg/kg), or saline was administered. NMDA-R and GABAA-R binding densities were examined by receptor autoradiography in several schizophrenia-relevant brain regions.', 'In both WT and NRG1 HET mice, phencyclidine treatment significantly reduced NMDA-R and GABAA-R binding density in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens. Acute treatment with LY379268 restored NMDA-R and GABAA-R levels in the two-hit mouse model comparable to olanzapine.\nAnswer: We demonstrate that the mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 restores excitatory and inhibitory deficits with similar efficiency as olanzapine in our two-hit schizophrenia mouse model. This study significantly contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of LY379268 and supports the use of agents aimed at mGluR2/3.\nAnswer:", "instruction_id": "55186223a40b3adb9fdf805a71d1b07c9a6066138f575274efd20850b5011385"}

{"instruction": "According to a recent report by the United Nations, only 9% of plastic waste is recycled. This is a major issue as plastic waste is polluting our oceans and harming wildlife.\nTo better understand the impact of recycling, let's take a look at some statistics. In 2018, the US generated 292.4 million tons of municipal solid waste, of which only 32.1% was recycled. This means that the majority of waste ended up in landfills, which not only takes up valuable space but also releases harmful greenhouse gases.\nIn addition to reducing the amount of waste in landfills, recycling also conserves natural resources. For example, recycling one ton of paper can save 17 trees, 7,000 gallons of water, and 463 gallons of oil. This is why it is important to recycle.\nNow, let's focus on plastic waste. Plastic takes hundreds of years to decompose and when it does, it releases harmful chemicals into the environment. By recycling plastic, we can reduce the amount of plastic waste in landfills and prevent it from ending up in our oceans.\nIn summary, recycling is important because it reduces the amount of waste in landfills, conserves natural resources, and helps protect our environment. Can you think of any other reasons why recycling is important?", "instruction_id": "f78785ae4bc9e56fe9ebff644e5339f5f3f9e93f91f53e8ffa07e5b9c3678596"}

{"instruction": "Please answer the following question: “India is OUR country” The quote we often preach but forget to deliver. I joined a club recently where I met a true Indian. I asked him about the most vivid memory of his life. One morning, as he was heading towards his office, he realized that the road he regularly takes was unusually bumpy. Upon inspection, he came to the conclusion that a truck carrying stones passed by on that road and unintentionally scattered few stones along the way. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes. What a great example of team work! It was this man’s discretionary efforts that brought a change in the thought process of the students, India’s next generation. We all point fingers and blame one another for societal problems but never act upon it. If this man, a true Indian, would have just blammed the truck driver and went on his way, would the road still be cleared? The next time we point fingers at someone for a social cause, we must keep in mind that that someone is an Indian just like us. Will a true Indian point fingers at an Indian? Are we pointing fingers at ourselves? In the end, we are all in the same team. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Each of the provided inputs contains a sentence with a target pronoun and a question about how to justify the coreference between a noun phrase and the target pronoun. Good practices involve the discussion about how the descriptions attached to the targeted pronoun relate to the noun phrase candidate in the question. The reasoning could come from one or multiple following knowledge types about commonsense: First: 'Property', the knowledge about property of objects (e.g., ice is cold). Second: 'Object', the knowledge about objects (e.g., cats have ears). Third: 'Eventuality', the knowledge about eventuality (e.g., 'wake up' happens before 'open eyes'). Forth: 'Spatial', the knowledge about spatial position (e.g., object at the back can be blocked). Fifth: 'Quantity', the knowledge about numbers (e.g., 2 is smaller than 10).

{"instruction": "Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Joan Crawford (Faye Dunaway) is a driven actress and compulsively clean housekeeper who tries to control the lives of those around her as tightly as she controls herself. To prepare for a work day at MGM Studios, she rises at 4:00 a.m. and engages in a strict morning ritual: scrubbing her face and arms with soap and boiling hot water, then plunging her face into a bowl of rubbing alcohol and ice to close the pores. When Helga (Alice Nunn), a new maid, thinks she has Joan's living room in spotless condition, Joan finds one minor detail that she overlooked and loses her temper. Joan is in a relationship with Hollywood lawyer Gregg Savitt (Steve Forrest), but her career is in a bit of a downswing. Despite desperately wanting a baby, she is unable to get pregnant: seven pregnancies when she was married to actor Franchot Tone have all ended in miscarriages. When she is denied an application for adoption, she enlists Gregg's help to secure a baby. Joan adopts a girl whom she names Christina (Mara Hobel), and later a boy, Christopher (Jeremy Scott Reinholt). Joan sometimes lavishes Christina with attention and luxuries such as an extravagant birthday party, but also enforces a very stern code of denial and discipline. When Christina is showered with gifts, Joan allows her to choose only one she likes best that she can keep, then donates the rest to charity. As Christina rebels against her mother, confrontations ensue. Joan overtakes Christina in a swimming-pool race and laughs at the child. Joan becomes enraged when Christina reacts with anger and locks her in the pool house. Later, Joan discovers Christina wearing her makeup and imitating her. Even though Christina openly denies it and despite her protests, Joan - thinking that Christina is making fun of her, always rummaging through her drawers, trying to find a way to make people look at her, and always looking at herself in the mirror - hysterically cuts off chunks of Christina's hair to humiliate her. Joan resents Gregg's allegiance to studio boss Louis B....\nAnswer:", "instruction_id": "18b2c340875ea18d994d1478bbfbb0411e24b93a6f16d1be1af4a44c360e15dc"}

It is the first star known to support as many planets as are orbiting our own sun, and researchers believe that this is the first of many to come. Researchers had known that seven planets were orbiting the star. But Google Artificial Intelligence -- which enables computers to \"learn\" -- looked at archival data obtained by NASA's planet-hunting Kepler telescope and uncovered the eighth planet. With the idea of eventually differentiating among exoplanets, Christopher Shallue, senior software engineer at Google AI in California, and Andrew Vanderburg, astronomer and NASA Sagan postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas, Austin, trained a computer how to differentiate between images of cats and dogs.For the first time, eight planets have been found orbiting Kepler-90It is tied with our solar system for a star hosting the most known planets \n Questions:Although _ is a sun-like star, the planets are all bunched together in tight orbits around it -- the same distance that Earth is from the sun.

{"instruction": "Write me the beginning of a script (formatted like a real movie script) for a comedy movie scene, based on the below information:\n\nAndy, a man in his 40s, is the Head of Computing at a rural high school. He has a loud, deep voice, and has more confidence than he has intelligence. He wants to be friends with his colleague exam invigilator John, so often tries and fails to impress him with his elaborate stories. He often bangs on about how he presents the school talent show. He has poor personal hygiene and can often be found making moaning noises while using disabled toilets, despite him having no obvious disability. Andy wears an untidy, stained white shirt. When addressing a group he starts with the words \"Right guys, settle down\".\n\nRoger, a man in his 50s, is a computing teacher working under Andy. He is an intelligent man, with grey hair and a laid back attitude to teaching. His classes are often out of control, while he sits there in despair. He has quiet contempt at the fact that Andy is the head of department, because he knows that he is much more qualified than Andy.\n\nJohn is a 69 year old man working as an exam invigilator. As he is past retirement it is unusual that he is still working, but we suspect it might be because he enjoys making people uncomfortable. John has wispy, grey hair and wears a pinstripe suit, several gold rings and red tinted glasses. He makes brazen, inappropriate remarks towards his colleagues.\n\nRuth, a woman in her 40s, is a languages teacher at the high school. She is so obsessed with the German language and culture that she regularly speaks to people in German and they don't understand what she's saying. She is attracted to women and regularly has to deter John's advances.", "instruction_id": "2a46425642975ad27b380b6529379a47a39b53cf189b387ca4264ccdf6a9f71f"}
